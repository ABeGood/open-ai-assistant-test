4.1.1. "Oscilloscope" mode menu
The "Oscilloscope" mode allows the user to view the signal waveform, its amplitude, and frequency. The voltage range is from 0 to 40 V, and the time range is from 2 to 20 ms.
This function can be useful for determining the presence of a signal in the vehicle (in data transmission lines: LIN, CAN, K-LINE, sensor outputs, etc.). For example, this mode can be used to check for the presence of a PWM signal at the voltage regulator's SIG connection and determine if there is no signal from the engine control unit.
When entering the "Oscilloscope" mode, automatic parameter configuration is performed. The horizontal and vertical limits can be adjusted manually. The range of horizontal scaling can be adjusted from 1 to 100 ms with a step size of 0.2 ms using the "⇧" or "⇩" buttons. The current range value is displayed in the top right corner of the screen, ms/div (see Figure 8 @D_18_IMG_008_DIAGRAM_oscilloscope-mode-display_fig8). 
The vertical scaling range is adjusted automatically according to the amplitude of the input signal. The maximum value of the input signal should not exceed 20 V.
"p-p Volt" – the current numerical value of the measured signal voltage, V.
"Spect" – signal spectrum. In the "Spect" mode, it is possible to analyze the spectrum of the signal within the frequency range from 500 Hz to 80 kHz. The horizontal axis of the graph represents the frequency of the input signal in kHz. The vertical axis represents the signal level in dB.
"Pause" – allows freezing the oscillogram on the display at the current moment in time.
The "Options" menu contains the following parameter groups:
• "Freq. Analyzer Windowing" – this group contains functions related to the peculiarities of digital signal processing.
• "Osc. Volt" – vertical axis parameters. You can predefine the maximum limit of the measured voltage on the vertical axis. The available ranges are 0...5, 0...10, 0...40 V.
• "Grids" – this section enables/disables the vertical and horizontal grid lines and displays the marker on the horizontal axis (Cursor).
Figure 8 @D_18_IMG_008_DIAGRAM_oscilloscope-mode-display_fig8

4.1.2. Calibration menu @D_18_IMG_009_DIAGRAM_calibration-menu-for-tester_fig9
This menu allows you to calibrate the measured voltage, "P-D" adjustment voltage, and the readings of the alternator's FR (load) according to the readings of additional measuring testers.
The tester readings are adjusted by changing the corresponding coefficients to match the voltage values displayed on the tester's screen with the readings of an external measuring device.
Access to the calibration menu is achieved by simultaneously pressing all three control buttons.
Figure 9. Calibration menu for the tester @D_18_IMG_009_DIAGRAM_calibration-menu-for-tester_fig9

5. Any interference with the electric diagram of the device is strictly prohibited.
6. When connecting the diagnostic cable to the alternator terminals, the "crocodile" clips must have fully insulated covers.
7. Avoid short-circuiting the crocodile clips together or to any current-carrying parts of the vehicle, including the body.
8. Turn off the tester when it is not in operation.
9. In case of failures in the operation of the tester, stop further operation and contact the manufacturer or sales representative.
WARNING! The manufacturer is not responsible for any damage or injury to human health resulting from non-compliance with the requirements of this user manual.

5.1. Safety guidelines
Only specially trained personnel who have been authorized to work on specific types of stands (instruments) and have undergone instruction on safe practices and methods may work with the tester.

5.2. Voltage regulator testing
The voltage regulators are tested using a nine-wire cable (Figure 3).
WARNING! The diagnostic mode must correspond to the type of regulator being tested.
WARNING! Some Bosch TM regulators require a high current for operation, which the tester cannot provide, making it impossible to test such regulators.

5.2.1. Connecting the voltage regulator to the tester
To assess the functionality of the voltage regulator, it is necessary to correctly connect the diagnostic cable to its terminals.
Using the original regulator number, search for information on the internet regarding the terminal designations. Additionally, you can refer to the information in Appendix 3, which indicates the connections for the most common regulators.
According to the identified terminal designation diagram, connect the diagnostic cable following the examples provided below.
WARNING! When connecting the clips to the connector, it is important to exercise caution as there is a risk (probability) of damaging (rendering inoperable) the regulator. The clips must be connected with fully covered insulation (Figure 10 @D_18_IMG_010_PHOTO_cable-fully-covered-insulation_fig10 @D_18_IMG_011_PHOTO_connecting-terminals-voltage-regulator-connector_fig10). 
Figure 10. Connecting terminals to the voltage regulator connector @D_18_IMG_010_PHOTO_cable-fully-covered-insulation_fig10 @D_18_IMG_011_PHOTO_connecting-terminals-voltage-regulator-connector_fig10

Figure 11 provides an example of the connection diagram for the ARE1054 regulator. @D_18_IMG_012_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE1054_fig11
Figure 11. Voltage regulator ARE1054 @D_18_IMG_012_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE1054_fig11

Using the information in Figure 11 @D_18_IMG_012_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE1054_fig11, we first determine the type of regulator based on the terminals in the connector and the information in Appendices 1 and 2. In this case, the terminals DFM and L(RVC) (also referred to as L(PWM)) identify this regulator as RVC.
Next, referring to Appendix 1, we determine which diagnostic cable clamps need to be connected to the regulator. The connection diagram for the ARE1054 regulator to the tester is provided in Table 1 and Figure 12 @D_18_IMG_013_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-ARE1054-connected-to-tester_fig12.

Figure 13 shows an example of the connection diagram for the ARE6076 regulator. @D_18_IMG_014_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6076_fig13
Figure 13. Voltage regulator ARE6076 @D_18_IMG_014_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6076_fig13

Based on the terminals in the connector and the information in Appendices 1 and 2, we determine the type of regulator. In this case, the terminals IG, S, and FR(M) do not identify the type of regulator. The terminal L identifies this regulator as L/D+ (Lamp).
Again, referring to Appendix 1, we determine which diagnostic cable clamps (connectors) need to be connected to the regulator. The connection diagram for the ARE6076 regulator to the tester is provided in Table 2 and Figure 14 @D_18_IMG_015_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-ARE6076-connected-to-tester_fig14.

Table 2 - Connecting the ARE6076 regulator to the tester

Figure 14. Voltage regulator ARE6076 connected to the tester terminals @D_18_IMG_015_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-ARE6076-connected-to-tester_fig14
When connecting the ARE6076 regulator, there is one particularity. Figure 14 @D_18_IMG_015_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-ARE6076-connected-to-tester_fig14 shows only one terminal F, to which we connect the green wire (F1). The second green wire (F2) needs to be connected to the B+ terminal. This is because one of the relay brushes is constantly connected to B+, and the excitation winding is controlled through the brush connected to the alternator's "minus" (A-circuit type).

Figure 15 shows an example of the connection diagram for the ARE6149P regulator. @D_18_IMG_016_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6149P_fig15
Figure 15. Voltage regulator ARE6149P @D_18_IMG_016_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6149P_fig15

Based on the terminals in the connector and the information in Appendices 1 and 2, we determine the type of regulator. In this case, the presence of the LIN terminal identifies this regulator as COM.
Again, referring to Appendix 1, we determine which diagnostic cable clamps (connectors) need to be connected to the regulator. The connection diagram for the ARE6149P regulator to the tester is provided in Table 3 and Figure 16 @D_18_IMG_017_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6149P-connected-to-tester_fig16.
Table 3 - Connecting the ARE6149P regulator to the tester
Voltage regulator terminal	Tester output terminal	Color marking of cable
B+	B+	red large
F	F1	green
Ps	ST1	blue
LIN	GC	yellow
G	B-	large black
G	F2	green

When connecting the ARE6149P regulator, there is one particularity. Figure 15 shows only one terminal F, to which we connect the F1 wire. The second wire, F2, needs to be connected to the B- terminal. This is because this regulator belongs to the B-circuit type. For such regulators, one of the brushes is constantly connected to "B-" of the alternator, and the excitation winding is controlled through "B+". @D_18_IMG_017_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6149P-connected-to-tester_fig16
Figure 16. Voltage regulator ARE6149P connected to the tester terminals @D_18_IMG_017_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6149P-connected-to-tester_fig16

5.2.2. Diagnostics
1. Connect the regulator to the tester using the procedures described in section 5.2.1.
2. In the main menu, select the diagnostic mode that corresponds to the type of regulator.
2.1. If the regulator being diagnosed has a COM connection terminal, wait for the tester to determine the ID and TYPE of the regulator.
3. After entering the diagnostic mode, the stabilization voltage should settle at 13.8V with a possible deviation of ±0.2V.
3.1. For L/D+ and C JAPAN regulators, the stabilization voltage should be within the range of 14 to 14.8V.
4. Change the set stabilization voltage from 13.2V to 14.5V. The measured stabilization voltage should change proportionally to the set value.
4.1. This step does not apply to L/D+ regulators.
4.2. For C JAPAN regulators, use the "Up" and "Down" buttons to set the set stabilization voltage to the "OFF" mode. The measured stabilization voltage should settle within the range of 12 to 12.7V.
5. Failure to meet any of the requirements in steps 2.1 to 4.2 indicates a fault in the regulator.
6. Exit the diagnostic mode and disconnect the clamps from the regulator.

5.3. Alternator testing
Testing the alternator in a vehicle is done using a four-wire cable (Figure 2) following these steps:
1. Use the alternator's original part number, typically located on the housing or rear cover, to search for information on the terminal designations in the alternator connector on the internet.
2. Determine the alternator type based on the terminals in the connector using the information from Appendix 1.
3. Connect the tester to the alternator according to the color coding described in step 4. The tester will be powered by the vehicle's battery (alternator), so it will turn on.
4. In the tester menu, select the corresponding alternator type and press the "Select" button. The tester will enter the testing mode.
4.1. If the alternator being diagnosed has a COM connection terminal, wait for the tester to determine the ID and TYPE of the alternator.
5. Start the vehicle engine and turn off all loads. Wait for the engine to stabilize at idle speed.
5.1. The stabilization voltage should settle at 13.8V with a possible deviation of ±0.2V.
5.2. For C JAPAN alternators, the stabilization voltage should be within the range of 12.1 to 12.7V.
6. Change the voltage value on the alternator using the "Up" and "Down" buttons within the range of 13.2 to 14.8V. The measured voltage should change proportionally with a possible deviation of ±0.2V.
6.1. For C JAPAN alternator, use the "Up" or "Down" button to switch the alternator to the "ON" mode. The stabilization voltage should settle within the range of 14 to 14.4V.
7. Set any voltage value on the alternator using the "Up" and "Down" buttons within the range of 13.2 to 14.8V. Increase the engine's crankshaft rotation speed to medium speed. The voltage value on the tester should remain unchanged (there may be slight fluctuations within ±0.2V, which is normal).
8. Without reducing the engine's crankshaft rotation speed, increase the load on the alternator by turning on the headlights, seat heaters, windshield defroster, and other electrical consumers. The voltage value on the tester should remain constant (there may be a decrease in voltage by 0.3V).
9. Turn off the engine.
10. Disconnect the clamps from the tester.
11. Failure to meet any of the requirements in steps 4.1, 5.1-8 indicates a fault in the alternator.

LRC (Options of voltage regulators)	(Load Response Control) Function of voltage regulator response delay on load increase on an alternator. Delay duration ranges from 2.5 to 15 seconds. On increasing the load (lights, cooler fan on), a voltage regulator adds driving voltage smoothly ensuring stability of engine drive rotation. Remarkably seen under idle running.
