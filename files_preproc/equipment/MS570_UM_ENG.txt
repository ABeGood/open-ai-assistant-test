5. APPROPRIATE USE
1. Use the workbench only for its intended purpose (see Section 1).
2. When working with various equipment, follow the operating documentation, including user manuals provided by the equipment manufacturers.
3. Use grounding, anti-static wrist straps, and mats to minimize the risk of damage to sensitive electronic components.
4. Keep cables organized to prevent bending and avoid interference with your work.
5. Do not use aggressive chemicals, bleach, acids, or alkalis for cleaning.
6. Use protective mats to prevent damage to the tabletop from cutting tools and heat exposure. Additionally, use stands for containers with special liquids such as alcohol, varnish, and glue to prevent spills.
7. Do not overload the workbench with heavy objects. Avoid dropping items on the surface.
8. To prevent damage, do not modify the workbench structure at your discretion.
WARNING! The manufacturer is not responsible for any damage or injury to human health resulting from non-compliance with the requirements of this user manual.

5.1. Safety instructions 
1. Only specialists with the appropriate qualifications for the task, who are authorized to work with specific types of equipment and have undergone training on safe work practices, including electrical safety measures, are allowed to work at the bench.
2. The workspace must be kept clean and well-lit. Clutter and poorly illuminated areas can lead to accidents.
3. When performing repair operations, personal protective equipment must be used, including safety glasses, gloves, and protective workwear.
4. Do not leave powered-on electronics, soldering stations, measuring instruments, or similar equipment unattended.
5. Rooms where soldering operations involving lead-based solder are performed must be equipped with supply and exhaust ventilation.

5.2. Preparing the workbench for use 
The workbench is delivered in packaging. Remove all packaging materials. The packaging is fully recyclable—dispose of it in designated waste collection areas for separate recycling.
The workbench should be placed on a level floor and positioned securely. It must be kept at least one meter away from heating devices and radiators.
Before use, connect the workbench to a 230V electrical network with a grounded outlet. Then, switch on the circuit breaker (see Pos. 1, Fig. 2).
