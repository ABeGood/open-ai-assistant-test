ATTENTION! Diagnostics for I-STARS generators is only possible in generator mode; starter mode is unavailable.

6.3. Alternator testing in manual mode
1. To start diagnostics, it is necessary to select the type of the alternator. Go to the "SELECT ALTERNATOR BY TYPE" menu displayed on the start screen.
2. In the appeared window, select the nominal voltage of the tested alternator (12V or 24V) by single clicking on the corresponding icon.
3. If it is necessary to test the alternator with the rotation speed that equals the one in the car, use «-» and «+» buttons to set the diameter of the pulley that is identical to the diameter of the pulley in the car. To confirm the chosen setting, press USE button.
ATTENTION! If the alternator speed is different, it doesn't affect the quality of testing.

4. Press "Test" to start the diagnostic procedure.
WARNING! Previously to entering the diagnostic mode by pressing button "Test", connect the outputs of the alternator voltage regulator to the corresponding terminals of the Test Bench.

5. Before starting the test bench drive, it is necessary to:
  5.1 If the alternator under diagnosis is of the COM or I-STARS type - wait for the test bench to determine the alternator's ID and TYPE.
  5.2 For Lamp-type alternators, the operating mode of the indicator lamp must be set to either 50 mA or 500 mA, depending on the alternator's design.
  5.3 For alternators equipped with a voltage regulator terminal labeled "A," "IG," "R," or "15," the "K15" button must be activated, and it should light up green.

6. Assess the alternator voltage regulator based on the following criteria:
  6.1 If the alternator under diagnosis is of the COM or I-STARS type, the test bench should identify the alternator's ID, COM speed, and TYPE, and the Errors indicator should display a message regarding a mechanical malfunction labeled "MEC."
  6.2 If the alternator includes an indicator lamp, the indicator lamp should light up.

7. Turn the "ROTATION SPEED" button to the left or right, depending on the direction of the alternator rotation to set the rotation speed within 100-150 rpm. Commonly, alternators rotate clockwise - if you look from pulley side.
WARNING! If the alternator has a freewheel clutch, carefully select the direction of rotation.

  7.1. Visually evaluate the rotation: there should be no vibration of the alternator. Testing procedure must be stopped in case there is a noise, which is a symptom of a mechanical fault.

8. Check what rotation rate the generation starts at as follows:
  8.1. Turn the knob ROTATION SPEED to smoothly increase the rotation until the output voltage gets the rated one. Most fault-free alternators starts generating from 700-850 rpm. Some alternators of type COM starts generating at more than 1200 rpm. There are the alternators with LRC (Load Response Control) function and with the delay at the output voltage adjustment.
  8.2. For the Lamp alternator types the voltage regulation rate should be set within 14 - 14.8 V for 12V alternators, within 28 - 29.8 V for 24V alternators.
  8.3. For the C JAPAN alternator type the voltage regulation rate should be set within 14 - 14.5 V.
  8.4. If the alternator equipped with the control lamp indicator, it should go off.
  8.5. If the diagnosed alternator is of COM or I-STARS type, the mechanical error should disappear.

9. Check the voltage regulation operation as follows:
  9.1. Turn the knob ROTATION SPEED to set the rotation within 1500 - 2000 rpm.
  9.2. For the Lamp alternators that have the pin S (AS, BVS) in the connector, you should check if the mentioned pin operates well. Connect the pin S with the bench test lead and press 'Test S pin' - the output voltage should increase. Press 'Test S pin' one more time - the output voltage should get back to the previous value.
  9.3. Turn the knob REGULATION GC smoothly to change the alternator output voltage within 13 - 15 V. The adjusted voltage (highlighted by green) should change respectively. For the "Lamp (L/FR)" alternator types without voltage control, p. 9.3 is skipped.
  9.4. For the C JAPAN and I-ELOOP alternator types, change the set stabilization voltage to OFF mode. The measured stabilization voltage value should be set within 12 - 12.7 V. Then change the set stabilization voltage to "ON mode. The measured stabilization voltage value should be within 14 - 14.5 V.

10. Check the alternator operation under the load as follows:
  10.1. Turn the knob ROTATION SPEED to set the rotation value within 2500 - 3000.
  10.2. Turn the knob REGULATION GC or press once to set the generation voltage 13.8V. For C-JAPAN and I-ELOOP alternator types switch ON mode.
  10.3. Turn the knob ELECTRICAL LOAD smoothly increase the load to alternator up to maximum. At this time, the output voltage value should be stable, and the alternating current value in the circuit B+, I, AC should not exceed 10% from the set load value (e.g., at the load 50A the value of I, AC should not exceed 5А). At the same time, the current oscillogram (highlighted by red) should not show the high peak points. The values should range within equal values.

11. To stop the diagnostics, throw off the load from alternator and stop the drive shortly pressing the knobs ELECTRICAL LOAD and ROTATION SPEED. Now you can dismount the alternator from the bench.
