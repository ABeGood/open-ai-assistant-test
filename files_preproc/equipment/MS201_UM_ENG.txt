WARNING! Improper fixing of shock absorbers in pneumatic clamps is the most common cause of the test bench malfunction.

6.3. Recording shock absorber characteristics
The working diagram of the shock absorber helps identify any deviations in its operation. Recording the working diagram is done with the piston's movement ranging from 50 to 100 mm. The temperature of the shock absorber before testing should be between 15 and 30 °C.
The sequence of operations, is as follows:
1. On the main screen, press the "Test turnover" button and then "Sensor calibration" (see position 2, Figure 12 @D_17_IMG_012_DIAGRAM_bench-main-menu_fig12). After this, diagnostic modes become active.
WARNING! During the test turnover, the operator's hand should be on the emergency shutdown button to instantly stop the bench's engine in case of an emergency.
2. Before recording the working diagram, perform at least four cycles of shock absorber pumping at a frequency of oscillations from 10 to 30 cycles/min. To do this, activate the "Manual mode." In this menu, use the "+" button (see position 4, Figure 15 @D_17_IMG_017_DIAGRAM_manual-mode-menu_fig15) to set the required frequency of oscillations. After completing the desired number of cycles, stop the bench's drive with the "Stop" button.
3. Activate the "Automatic mode." Then, go to the settings of this mode using the "Settings" button. In this menu, set parameters such as frequency of oscillations and duration for each stage. The maximum piston speed parameter is informational and is calculated automatically. To change the value, press the field with the value, delete the current value using the keyboard, and then enter the new one. The established sequence of operations can be saved and reused in the future.
Figure 26. Setup menu for recording the working diagram of the shock absorber @D_17_IMG_030_DIAGRAM_setup-menu-recording-working-diagram_fig26

3.1. For a more objective assessment of the shock absorber's condition, check its operation with closed and opening rebound and compression valves.
3.2. Record the working diagram with closed valves at a maximum piston speed within the range of 0.08 to 0.20 m/s, corresponding to frequencies of:
- 31 to 95 cycles/min with a piston stroke of 50 mm;
- 20 to 47 cycles/min with a piston stroke of 100 mm
3.3. Record the working diagram with opening rebound and compression valves at a maximum piston speed within the range of 0.25 to 0.52 m/s, corresponding to frequencies of:
- 95 to 180 cycles/min with a piston stroke of 50 mm;
- 47 to 98 cycles/min with a piston stroke of 100 mm.
4. During the recording of the working diagram, pay attention to the sounds produced by the shock absorber. Knocking, squeaking, and other noises are not allowed. "Hissing" caused by fluid leakage through the valves is acceptable.
5. During the recording of the working diagram, fluid leakage through the rod seals (aside from the inevitable lubrication of the sliding surfaces) is not allowed. Fluid leakage indicates a faulty shock absorber.
6. After completing all recording stages, the bench's drive will stop. Save the recorded diagram by (see Figure 27 @D_17_IMG_031_DIAGRAM_bench-settings-menu_fig27): 
Accessing the corresponding menu;

2 – Field for entering a new folder name.
3 – Field for entering a new result name.
4 – Buttons for creating or deleting a result (folder).
5 – Field for searching saved results.
6 – Button to call the on-screen keyboard.

7. The assessment of the shock absorber's condition is performed by comparing the obtained working diagram with a reference diagram recorded from a new shock absorber of the same manufacturer.
The process of comparing results is carried out in the "Testing results" menu (see Figure 28 @D_17_IMG_032_DIAGRAM_diagnostic-results-comparison-screen_fig28). Use buttons "1," "2," and "3" to select the displayed graphs.
A shock absorber is considered functional if the deviations in resistance forces from the values of the reference sample (new shock absorber) are within ±15% for rebound and ±20% for compression. Additionally, the diagram's characteristics should be similar.
Figure 28. Diagnostic results comparison screen @D_17_IMG_032_DIAGRAM_diagnostic-results-comparison-screen_fig28

7. DIAGNOSIS OF ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED SHOCK ABSORBERS
The bench allows testing the functionality of electronically controlled shock absorbers using the MS203 adapter. The adapter provides the ability to manually control one or two solenoid valves of the shock absorber. The adapter can adjust the degree of solenoid valve opening from 10% to 95%.

7.1. Description of the MS203 Adapter
The adapter has the following connectors (see Fig. 29 @D_17_IMG_033_PHOTO_MS203-adapter-appearance_fig29): 
1 – USB connector for communication with the bench.
2 – Power connector (type 5.5 x 2.5 mm).
3 – Connector for connecting diagnostic cables.
Figure 29. Appearance of the adapter @D_17_IMG_033_PHOTO_MS203-adapter-appearance_fig29

The adapter kit includes five special cables and one universal cable, which are designed to connect the adapter to the solenoid valves of the shock absorber being tested. Each special cable (see Fig. 30 @D_17_IMG_034_PHOTO_special-cable-connectors_fig30) is equipped with a connector for connection to the adapter (position 1) and a connector for connection to the unit under test (position 2).
Figure 30 @D_17_IMG_034_PHOTO_special-cable-connectors_fig30

The universal cable (see Fig. 31 @D_17_IMG_035_PHOTO_universal-cable-connectors_fig31) is equipped with a connector for connection to the adapter (position 2) and alligator clips (position 1).
Figure 31 @D_17_IMG_035_PHOTO_universal-cable-connectors_fig31

The universal cable has the following color coding:
Red – common positive contact;
Black and blue – PWM signal control of the solenoid valves.

The adapter should be connected to the bench in the following order:
1. Connect the adapter to the power supply unit included in the kit.
2. Connect the adapter's power supply unit to a single-phase 230V network.
3. Connect the adapter to the bench using a USB cable. After this, the "Manual Diagnosis" menu on the bench will display buttons for activating the solenoid valves and sliders for adjusting the valve opening degree (see Fig. 32 @D_17_IMG_036_DIAGRAM_manual-mode-menu-with-MS203-adapter_fig32).

4. Activate the "Manual mode" diagnostic mode.
5. Pump the shock absorber by performing at least four compression cycles at a frequency of 10 to 30 min⁻¹.
6. After pumping, set the compression frequency of the shock absorber to 95 to 180 min⁻¹.
7. Activate the solenoid valve(s) using the "Valve" button.
8. Gradually increase and decrease the degree of opening of the solenoid valve(s).
8.1 The functionality of the solenoid valve(s) is determined by the operating diagram graph, which should change proportionally to the valve(s) opening degree.
9. After completing the diagnostics, stop the stand drive, disconnect the cable from the shock absorber, and then it can be removed from the bench.

8 TEST BENCH MAINTENANCE
Test bench is intended for long-lasting operation under twenty-four-hour schedule. However, for trouble-free enduring operation it is essential to inspect the test bench and observe preventive measures described below with recommended intervals. Inspection and preventive measures should be carried out by a qualified specialist.
Special attention should be paid to the following aspects of daily inspection:
• Appropriate operation of the motor (no unusual sounds, vibration, etc.).
• Appropriate ambient conditions for the test bench use (temperature, humidity, air pollution, vibration, etc.)
• Correspondence of supply voltage range to the test bench operation requirements.
Weekly inspection of the test bench must include the following:
• Visual inspection of the bearing unit and puller shaft for traces of oil leaks.
• Check the moving parts of the upper and lower pneumatic clamps for sufficient lubrication.

8.1. Changing shock absorber working stroke
Figure 31. Shock absorber stroke adjustment mechanism @D_17_IMG_037_PHOTO_shock-absorber-stroke-adjustment-mechanism_fig31
The working stroke of the shock absorber shall be adjusted as follows:
1. Turn on the bench.
2. Open the test area door and the mechanical compartment door.
3. Loosen the 4th bolt pos.1 fig. 31 @D_17_IMG_037_PHOTO_shock-absorber-stroke-adjustment-mechanism_fig31.

4. The change in the working stroke is caused by the rotation of the adjustment screw pos.2 of fig. 31 @D_17_IMG_037_PHOTO_shock-absorber-stroke-adjustment-mechanism_fig31: counterclockwise - increase, clockwise - decrease.
4.1. You need to control the value of the change of turn by the parameter «Position» on the initial menu of the bench. The value of the parameter «Position» should be changed to the value calculated by the formula:

Value of change of parameter «Position» = (New working stroke - current working stroke)/2.

WARNING! It is prohibited to set the shock absorber at more than 80% of its maximum stroke because this may cause the shock absorber and/or the bench to break down.
5. Tighten 4 bolts pos.1.
6. Close the mechanical compartment door

8.2. Pneumatic clamps oiling
Once a month check the lubrication of wear surfaces of linear cams (n.1, Fig. 6, 7 @D_17_IMG_006_DIAGRAM_upper-pneumatic-clamp-components_fig6 @D_17_IMG_007_DIAGRAM_lower-pneumatic-clamp-components_fig7) and glide slide blocks (n.2, Fig. 6, 7 @D_17_IMG_006_DIAGRAM_upper-pneumatic-clamp-components_fig6 @D_17_IMG_007_DIAGRAM_lower-pneumatic-clamp-components_fig7). Litol-24 is a commonly used grease. Other lithium-based greases are also

8.3. Bearing unit oiling
As the lubricating grease picks up dirt and loses its qualities with time, it should be refreshed every once in a while. The intervals at which the lubrication should be replaced or refreshed depend on the severity of use. However, the maximum interval shouldn't exceed two years. During the first two times, lubrication can be refreshed. Subsequently, it must be replaced. Litol-24 is a commonly used lubricant. Other lithium-based greases are also usable.
To replenish the lubricating oil, use the nipple on the bearing unit (Fig.32 @D_17_IMG_038_PHOTO_nipple-on-bearing-unit_fig32) and a special syringe.
Follow the instruction below to oil the bearing unit:
1. Disconnect the test bench form a supply line and wait for 10 minutes.
2. Open the door of the mechanical unit.
3. Remove the cap from the nipple, having it and the adjoining surfaces previously cleaned from dirt and dust.
4. Use a special syringe to inject grease into the nipple. Continue to pump until you see grease squeezing out from the bearing.
5. Upon finishing, remove the remaining grease with a cleaning cloth.

8.4. Puller shaft oiling
The lubricant type as well as grease replenishment and changing schedule are similar to the ones used for bearing unit maintenance (Section 8.2).
Follow the instruction below to oil the puller shaft:
1. Disconnect the test bench form a supply line and wait for 10 minutes.
2. Open the door of the mechanical unit.
3. Clean the grease nipples (Fig.33 @D_17_IMG_039_PHOTO_grease-nipples-on-puller-shaft_fig33) and adjoining surfaces from dust and dirt.
4. Screw off one of the grease nipples.
5. Use a special syringe to inject grease into the nipple. Continue to pump until you see grease squeezing out from the bearing.
6. Upon finishing, remove the remaining grease with a cleaning cloth. Screw in the grease nipple.

8.5. Gear motor inspection and maintenance
Perform the following maintenance procedures:
Every 500 hours of work or every month:
1) Inspect the gear motor visually for possible oil leakage.
2) Remove dust with a vacuum cleaner - the layer of dust accumulated on the gear motor cannot exceed 5mm thick.
Every 5 years:
Replace synthetic oil.

8.6. Cleaning and care
Use soft tissues or waste cloth to clean the test bench surfaces. Clean the touch screen with a special fibrous tissue and spray for display screens. Do not use any abrasive materials or solvents to avoid damage to the screen or corrosion.
