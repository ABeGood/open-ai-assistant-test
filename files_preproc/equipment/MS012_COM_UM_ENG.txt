5.1. Safety guidelines
1. The tester shall be operated by the persons who completed the special training on the high-voltage battery safe operation and have the relevant electrical safety permit.
2. Turn off the tester for cleaning and in emergencies.
3. The work area must always be clean, with good light illumination, and spacious.

5.2. Voltage regulator connection
A proper connection of the voltage regulator to the diagnostic terminals of the tester is necessary for evaluation of the regulator performance.
WARNING! To avoid damage to the tester or its failure, extra care is to be taken when connecting the cable clips to the contacts inside the terminals. The cable clips must be completely insulated (Fig.14 @D_19_IMG_014_PHOTO_cable connection-clip-completely-insulated_fig14 @D_19_IMG_015_PHOTO_cable-clips-connection_fig14). 
Figure 14 - Connection of the cable clips to the contacts inside the terminal @D_19_IMG_014_PHOTO_cable connection-clip-completely-insulated_fig14 @D_19_IMG_015_PHOTO_cable-clips-connection_fig14

Search online the information on the terminals marking by the voltage regulator part number. You may also find information on connection of the most common voltage regulator types in Appendix 3 of the actual Operation Instruction.

The diagram for connection of voltage regulator ARE1054 is shown as an example in Figure 15 @D_19_IMG_016_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE1054_fig15.
Figure 15. Voltage regulator ARE1054 @D_19_IMG_016_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE1054_fig15

Identify the voltage regulator type by its connection terminals shown in Figure15 and using the information set out in Appendices 1, 2. In the example given, these are terminals DFM and L(RVC) (can be marked as L(PWM)). Terminal DFM cannot be used for identification of the voltage regulator type, while we can identify it as RVC-type by terminal L(RVC).
Then we refer to Appendix 1 to determine the tester terminals for connection of the voltage regulator (Fig.16 @D_19_IMG_017_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE1054-connected-to-tester_fig16). Table 1 and Figure 16 show the diagram for connection of voltage regulator ARE1054.

Figure 17 – Voltage regulator ARE6076 @D_19_IMG_018_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6076_fig17

Voltage regulator type can be identified by its connection terminals and using the information set out in Appendices 1, 2. In this case, we cannot identify the voltage regulator type by terminals IG, S, and FR(M), while it can be identified as L/FR by terminal L.
Then we refer to Appendix 1 to determine the tester terminals for connection of the voltage regulator. Table 2 and Figure 18 show the diagram for connection of the voltage regulator to the tester.

Figure 18 – Diagram of voltage regulator ARE6076 connection to the tester @D_19_IMG_019_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6076-connection-to-tester_fig18

Connection of voltage regulator ARE6076 has some specifics:
Firstly, the voltage regulator must be connected to three output terminals B+ while the tester has only two. The problem can be solved by connecting a spare blue cable to one of the red cables supplied with a special socket connector which substitutes the missing terminal of the tester (Fig.19 @D_19_IMG_020_PHOTO_additional-cable-B+-connection_fig19). 
Figure 19 – Connection of additional cable B+ @D_19_IMG_020_PHOTO_additional-cable-B+-connection_fig19

Secondly, there are two cables - F1 and F2, both of which must be connected to the voltage regulator brushes or their respective terminals. Figure 17 shows only one terminal – F, to which cable F1 must be connected. The other green cable (F2) must be connected to terminal B+, since one of the brushes is permanently connected to B+ while the excitation winding is controlled through the brush connected to the alternator negative terminal (A-circuit type).

Figure 20 shows the connection diagram of voltage regulator ARE6149P as an example. @D_19_IMG_021_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6149P_fig20
Figure 20 – Voltage regulator ARE6149P @D_19_IMG_021_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6149P_fig20

Voltage regulator type should be identified by its connection terminals and using the information set out in Appendices 1, 2. In this case, there is only one terminal – LIN, that identifies this voltage regulator as COM type.
Then we refer to Appendix 1 to determine the tester terminals for connection of the voltage regulator. Table 3 and Figure 21 show the diagram for connection of the voltage regulator ARE6149P to the tester.

Table 3 – Connection of voltage regulator ARE6149P to the tester @D_19_IMG_022_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6149P-connected-to-tester_fig21

G	F2	green
Figure 21. Voltage regulator ARE6149P connected to the tester terminals @D_19_IMG_022_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6149P-connected-to-tester_fig21

Connection of voltage regulator ARE6149P has a special aspect. Figure 20 @D_19_IMG_021_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-ARE6149P_fig20 shows only one terminal – F, for connection of cable F1. The other cable – F2 must be connected to terminal B-. Consequently, one of the brushes is permanently connected to B- of the alternator, while the excitation winding is controlled through terminal B+.

5.3. Voltage regulator diagnostics
Before launching the diagnostic procedure, set up the resistance of the stator winding in the main menu (Fig.4 @D_19_IMG_004_DIAGRAM_tester-main-menu_fig4) with adjustment knob EL LOAD. In case, the resistance value of the stator winding is known, set this (measured) value. If the resistance value is not known, set it as follows:
• 5 Ohm for 12V;
• 22 Ohm for 24V.

The common diagnostic procedure for a majority of voltage regulators is as follows:
1) Connect the voltage regulator to the tester output terminals.
2) Set up the resistance of the stator winding.
3) Select the nominal voltage of the tested voltage regulator.
4) Select the type of the tested voltage regulator.
5) Evaluate the control lamp behavior: red indication must be on when the speed is below 700 rpm, the indication must turn white (off) when the speed is above 800-1200 rpm.
6) Evaluate the voltage regulator response to the load change set with adjustment knob EL LOAD.
7) Evaluate the voltage regulator ability to adjust to the stabilizing voltage set with knob VOLTAGE.
WARNING! The selected test mode (Fig. 6 @D_19_IMG_006_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-type-selection-12V_fig6 , 7 @D_19_IMG_007_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-type-selection-24V_fig7) must correspond to the voltage regulator type.

9. Failure to perform as described in articles 4-8 of the actual Operation Instruction signals the voltage regulator malfunction.
10. Press BACK to exit the test mode. Disconnect the cable clips from the voltage regulator.

5.3.4. Diagnostics of 12/24V voltage regulators of COM type
1. Connect the voltage regulator to the tester as described in article 3.2 of the actual Instruction.
2. In the main menu (Fig.4 @D_19_IMG_004_DIAGRAM_tester-main-menu_fig4) select the nominal voltage of the tested voltage regulator: 12V or 24V.
3. In the menu for selection of the voltage regulator by type (Fig.6 @D_19_IMG_006_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-type-selection-12V_fig6 , 7 @D_19_IMG_007_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-type-selection-24V_fig7) select the voltage regulator terminal and press TEST. The tester will enter the test mode.
4. Wait for the tester to complete the data read-out. The diagnostic procedure can be continued when message "CONNECTED" appears in box "LIN STATUS".
5. Rotate adjustment knob "EL LOAD" to set the load at 100%. Set stator speed "STATOR RPM" below 700 rpm with adjustment knob "STATOR". Value "MEC" in box "ERRORS" must turn red. When we increase the stator speed "STATOR RPM" up to more than 1200 rpm, this value "MEC" in box "ERRORS" must turn white. This will mean the system of voltage regulator self-diagnostics is fault-free.
5.1 If symbol EL in box "ERRORS" turns red when we increase the stator speed "STATOR RPM" up to more 1200 rpm, it signals an electric fault of the voltage regulator.
6. Turn adjustment knob "STATOR" until "STATOR RPM" value is set in the range of 2000 to 6000 rpm. Set the voltage value "SET V" in the range of 13.1-14.5V for 12V regulators, 26 – 29V for 24V by rotating adjustment knob "VOLTAGE". The value in box "VOLTAGE, V" must change in proportion to the pre-set one. If so, the channel for setting voltage is operable.
7. Rotate adjustment knob "EL LOAD" to change the value in the range from 10 to 100%. If the value in box "EXCITATION" changes, it means that the voltage regulator responds to the load change.
8. Failure to perform as described in articles 4-7 of the Instruction signals the voltage regulator malfunction.
9. Press BACK to exit the test mode. Disconnect the clips from the voltage regulator.

6. TESTER MAINTENANCE
