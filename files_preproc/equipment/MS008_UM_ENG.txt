6. ALTERNATOR TESTING
For all types of alternators, the following common diagnostic stages are provided:
1. Installation of the alternator on the bench and its fixation.
2. Installation of the belt on the pulley and its tensioning.
3. Connection of power wires to the alternator. For convenient connection, an adapter should be screwed onto the positive terminal of the alternator for the connection of the power terminal B+.
4. Connect the diagnostic cable to the terminals in the alternator socket.
5. Select the appropriate parameters for the alternator test.
6. Diagnosis of the alternator.
7. Dismounting the unit from the bench.

6.1. Installation and de-installation of the alternator
1. Use the "Release Chain" button to increase the length of the chain sufficient for securing the alternator. A single press increases the length of the chain, and a subsequent press stops this process.
2. Position the alternator on the working platform so that the pulley is directly above the belt.
3. Place the chain on the alternator and secure the end of the chain on the bench. Then use the "Tighten Chain" button to tension the chain; the bench will automatically stop the chain tensioning process.
CAUTION! Be careful not to injure your fingers.
4. Use the "Release Belt" button to loosen the belt enough to fit it onto the alternator pulley. A single press loosens the belt, and a subsequent press stops this process.
5. Use the "Tighten Belt" button to tension the belt. The bench will automatically stop the tensioning process.
CAUTION! Ensure that the position of the chain on the alternator is such that after tightening the belt, the alternator is in a horizontal position (see Fig. 11 @D_23_IMG_018_PHOTO_alternator-installation-fixation_fig11). Misalignment of the alternator leads to belt slippage on the pulley and rapid wear.
Figure 11. Installation and Fixation of the Alternator on the Bench @D_23_IMG_018_PHOTO_alternator-installation-fixation_fig11
6. Screw the adapter onto the "B+" terminal (see Fig. 12 @D_23_IMG_019_PHOTO_adapter-B-plus-terminal_fig12).
Figure 12 @D_23_IMG_019_PHOTO_adapter-B-plus-terminal_fig12
7. Connect the black power wire "B-" to the unit's housing and the red power wire "B+" to the adapter (see Fig. 13 @D_23_IMG_020_PHOTO_power-wires-connection_fig13).
Figure 13. Connection of Power Wires to the Alternator @D_23_IMG_020_PHOTO_power-wires-connection_fig13
8. After diagnosis, disassembly of the alternator is performed in reverse order.
WARNING! Disassembly of the alternator is allowed only after the drive has completely stopped, and the testing mode has been exited.
6.2. Connecting the diagnostic cable to the alternator connector
To assess the operability of the alternator, it is necessary to select an appropriate special cable or correctly connect the universal cable to the terminals in the alternator socket.
To select a special cable, go to the alternator database (see Fig. 14 @D_23_IMG_021_DIAGRAM_alternator-database_fig14). Using the original alternator number, which is often located on the housing or rear cover, search for the alternator in the "Search" tab.
ATTENTION! Diagnostics of alternators: Valeo "Stop-Start" 12 V system (alternator type IStars), "I-ELOOP" (Mazda) and alternators without voltage regulator (alternator type F/67), is possible only using a special cable (see appendix 1).
Figure 14 @D_23_IMG_021_DIAGRAM_alternator-database_fig14

If the desired alternator is in the bench's database, its type, main characteristics, photo, connection terminal designations, and the number of the required cable will be displayed. If the desired alternator is in the bench's database, its type, main characteristics, photo, connection terminal designations, and the number of the required cable will be displayed.
Connect the special cable to the bench and the alternator, after which you can proceed with the diagnosis.
In case the alternator is not in the database, it is necessary to find the terminal designation in the alternator socket on the internet. Then, by identifying the alternator type based on the socket terminals, using the information in Appendix 1, you can select a suitable special cable or connect the universal cable MS-33001.
As an example, let's consider connecting the universal cable to the Bosch 0986049191 alternator (Fig. 15 @D_23_IMG_022_PHOTO_bosch-alternator_fig15 @D_23_IMG_023_DIAGRAM_bosch-terminal-designations_fig15).

6.4. Manual mode alternator diagnostics
1. After fixing and connecting the alternator, go to the "Alternator" menu.
2. In the opened window, select: the nominal voltage of the diagnosed alternator, 12 or 24 V, the type of alternator, the maximum test current, the diameter of the pulley. When using the alternator database, the test parameters are set automatically.
  2.1. In the upper right corner of the program, select the maximum current that the alternator can provide, usually indicated on the alternator itself. During the testing process, this current will not be exceeded when the load reaches 100%.
WARNING! Selecting a maximum test current for the alternator that exceeds its passport data may damage the alternator.
3. To start the diagnostics process, press the "Manual test" button.
  3.1. After activating the diagnostics mode, a preliminary alternator check window will open, see Figure 22 @D_23_IMG_032_DIAGRAM_preliminary-alternator-check_fig22.
Figure 22 @D_23_IMG_032_DIAGRAM_preliminary-alternator-check_fig22
  3.2. Using the alternator drive control buttons, set the speed of the alternator pulley rotation within the range of 100 to 150 rpm.
WARNING! If the alternator pulley has a freewheel clutch, carefully select the direction of rotation.
  3.3. Visually assess whether the alternator rotates normally. If there are noises or vibrations from the alternator indicating mechanical malfunction or incorrect alternator installation, stop the diagnostics by pressing the "Cancel" button.
  3.4. To continue the diagnostics, press the "Ok" button.
4. Evaluate the operation of the voltage regulator according to the following criteria:
  4.1. If the diagnosed alternator is of the COM or IStars type, the bench should identify the alternator's ID, COM speed, and TYPE, and the Errors indicator should display a message about mechanical malfunction "MEC".
  4.2. If the alternator has a control lamp, the indicator of the control lamp should light up.
5. Conduct a check to determine at what RPM the alternator starts generating, for this:
WARNING! For alternators with a voltage regulator terminal labeled "A" or "IG" or "15", activate the "K15" button.
  5.1. Gradually increase the speed using the alternator drive control buttons until the output voltage reaches the set value. Most functional alternators start generating at 700-850 rpm. Some COM-type alternators start generating at speeds above 1200 rpm, and there are also alternators with Load Response Control (LRC) function that have a temporary delay in generating.
  5.2. For Lamp-type alternators, the stabilization voltage should be within 14 to 14.8 V for 12V alternators and 28 to 29.8 V for 24V alternators.
  5.3. If the alternator has a control lamp indicator, it should turn off.
  5.4. If the diagnosed alternator belongs to the COM or IStars type, the mechanical error should disappear.
6. Evaluate the operation of the voltage regulator by:
  6.1. Setting the drive speed within 1500-2000 rpm.
  6.2 (For Lamp-type alternators without output voltage control, this step is not required). Using the output voltage control buttons, smoothly adjust the alternator's output voltage within the range from minimum to maximum. The measured voltage should change proportionally.
  6.3. For C JAPAN type alternators, set the stabilization voltage setting to "OFF" mode - the measured stabilization voltage should be equal to the battery voltage. Then set the stabilization voltage setting to "ON" mode - the measured stabilization voltage should be within 14 to 14.7 V.
7. Evaluate the alternator's performance under load by:
  7.1. Setting the drive speed within 2500-3000 rpm.
  7.2. Setting the generation voltage within 14 to 14.8 V. For C JAPAN type alternators, switch to the "ON" mode.
  7.3. Gradually increase the load on the alternator using the load control buttons (see Figure 23 @D_23_IMG_037_DIAGRAM_automatic-test-mode-menu_fig23) while keeping the output voltage constant, and the alternating current value in the B+ circuit "I, AC" should not exceed 10% of the set load value (for example, at a load of 50 A, the "I, AC" value should not exceed 5 A). Also, there should be no significant peaks observed on the current oscillogram, the values should fluctuate within consistent limits.
  To determine the technical condition of the alternator, it is sufficient to set a load from 50 to 80 A.
8. For IStars type alternators, perform a check of its operation in starter mode by:
  8.1. Stopping the alternator drive.
  8.2. Pressing the "Starter" button to start the test mode, during which the alternator should reach the idle speed of the engine.
9. To complete the alternator diagnostics, stop the alternator drive and then exit the test mode. After that, the alternator can be removed from the bench.
10. Failure to comply with any of the requirements in points 4 - 8.2 indicates a fault in the alternator.

6.5. Diagnostics of alternators without voltage regulator
The diagnosis of alternators without voltage regulators is performed using the MS-33042 (42A) cable. The sequence of operations is as follows:
1. Fix the alternator on the bench. Put the belt on the pulley and tension the belt.
2. Connect the MS-33042 (42A) cable to the alternator according to Table 5.

Table 5 - Connection of a alternator without a voltage regulator

F1	Green
F2	Green

3. Go to the "Alternator" menu and in the opened window select: the nominal voltage of the alternator being diagnosed (12 V), the type of alternator (Lamp), the maximum test current, and the pulley diameter (if the value is known).
4. Before activating the diagnostic mode, a preliminary alternator check window will open, see Fig. 26 @D_23_IMG_041_DIAGRAM_regulator-database-search_fig26.
  4.1. Using the alternator drive control buttons, set the alternator pulley speed within the range of 100 to 150 rpm.
  4.2. Visually assess: is the alternator rotating normally. If there are noises or vibrations from the alternator indicating mechanical failure or incorrect mounting, stop the diagnosis by pressing the "Cancel" button.
  4.3. To continue the diagnosis, press the "Ok" button.
5. Conduct a check at which speed alternator begins, for this smoothly increase the drive speed until the output voltage increases and becomes equal to 13.9 to 14.8 V.
6. Evaluate alternator performance under load by:
  6.1. Set the drive speed within the range of 2500 - 3000 rpm.
  6.2. Smoothly increase the load on the alternator, while the output voltage value should remain constant and the value of alternating current in circuit B+ "I, AC" should not exceed 10% of the set load value. Also, the current oscillogram should not show large peaks, the values should fluctuate within the same limits.
7. To complete the alternator diagnostics, stop the alternator drive and then exit the test mode. The alternator can then be removed from the bench.
8. Failure to fulfill one of the requirements of paragraphs. 5 - 6.2 indicates a faulty alternator winding.

6.6. Automatic mode diagnostic mode for alternators
1. After fixing and connecting the alternator, go to the "Alternator" menu.
2. In the opened window, select: the nominal voltage of the diagnosed alternator, 12 or 24 V, the type of alternator, the maximum test current, the diameter of the pulley (if the value is known). When using the alternator database, the test parameters are set automatically.
3. Next, select the script to be used during the automatic test: Advanced script or Quick script, then press the "Automatic test" button.

8. VOLTAGE REGULATOR DIAGNOSTICS
For all types of voltage regulators, the following general diagnostic steps are provided:
1) Connecting the regulator to the test bench;
2) Selecting the type and nominal voltage of the diagnosed regulator;
3) Evaluating the operability of the control lamp. At speeds close to zero, the red battery discharge indicator should light up. When the speed exceeds 800 - 1200 rpm, the indicator should go out;
4) The operability of the "S" terminal is evaluated;
5) The ability of the regulator to adjust to the specified stabilization voltage is assessed.
WARNING! The test bench checks voltage regulators without load, so some Bosch TM regulators cannot be tested by the bench.

8.1. Voltage regulator connection
For the accurate evaluation of the technical condition of alternator, you shall properly connect it to the bench diagnostic outputs.
Referring to the voltage regulator OEM, find the information on the regulator connector terminal references in the bench database (fig. 26 @D_23_IMG_041_DIAGRAM_regulator-database-search_fig26): Then connect the diagnostic cable wires and bench outputs to the regulator, referring to the provided layout.
Once the regulator has been connected press button «Manual test». The bench gets to the appropriate diagnostics mode. Now you can start the diagnostics of the regulator (the process is described below).
WARNING! Be cautious when connecting the crocodile clips with the connector - to prevent the regulator from the damaging. Use the crocodile clip completely isolated (fig. 27 @D_23_IMG_042_PHOTO_crocodile-clip-isolated_fig27 @D_23_IMG_043_PHOTO_terminal-connection_fig27) or use the relevant wire (fig. 5 @D_23_IMG_005_PHOTO_adapting-wire-kit_fig5).
If you haven't found the regulator in the database, look for the information on the regulator terminal references on the Internet. Referring to the found layout of the regulator terminal references, connect the diagnostics cable and bench outputs with the regulator referring to the examples below.
Figure 26. Regulator database search display @D_23_IMG_041_DIAGRAM_regulator-database-search_fig26
Figure 27. Connector terminal connection @D_23_IMG_042_PHOTO_crocodile-clip-isolated_fig27 @D_23_IMG_043_PHOTO_terminal-connection_fig27

Figure 28 @D_23_IMG_044_DIAGRAM_regulator-ARE1054_fig28 illustrates the example of the connection layout for the regulator ARE1054.
Figure 28. Regulator ARE1054 @D_23_IMG_044_DIAGRAM_regulator-ARE1054_fig28
Use the information in the Appendix 1 to determine the regulator type referring to the connector terminals (fig. 28 @D_23_IMG_044_DIAGRAM_regulator-ARE1054_fig28). The terminal L(RVC) points to RVC regulator type. Then, referring to the Appendix 1, determine what diagnostics cable and bench outputs shall be connected with the regulator. The layout of the connection of the regulator ARE1054 to the bench is provided in the table 5.

Figure 29. Regulator ARE6076 @D_23_IMG_045_DIAGRAM_regulator-ARE6076_fig29

Referring to the connector terminals and the information in the Appendix 1, determine the regulator type. In this case, the terminals IG, S и FR(M) don't determine the regulator type. The terminal L points to Lamp regulator type. Mow, referring to the Appendix 1, determine what diagnostics cable and bench outputs shall be connected with the regulator. The layout of the connection of the regulator ARE6076 to the bench is provided in the table 6.

Table 6 - Connection of voltage regulator ARE6076 to the bench

There's a specific thing about the connection of ARE6076 regulator. The figure 29 @D_23_IMG_045_DIAGRAM_regulator-ARE6076_fig29 illustrates only the terminal F which we connect with the bench output FLD1. The bench output FLD2 shall be connected to the terminal B+ since one of the relay brushes is permanently connected to В+ while the excitation winding coil is being controlled through the brush connected to the alternator 'negative' (A-circuit breaking type).

Figure 30 @D_23_IMG_046_DIAGRAM_regulator-ARE6149P_fig30 illustrates the example of connection layout of ARE6149P regulator.
Figure 30. Regulator ARE6149P @D_23_IMG_046_DIAGRAM_regulator-ARE6149P_fig30

Referring to the voltage regulator connector terminals and the Appendix 1, identify the regulator type. Here we have just one LIN terminal that points to COM regulator.
Now, referring to the Appendix 1, determine what diagnostics cable and bench outputs shall be connected with the regulator. The layout of the connection of the regulator ARE6149P to the bench is provided in the table 7.

Table 7 - Connection of voltage regulator ARE6149P to the bench
Voltage regulator terminal	Bench output	Diagnostic cable wire	Wire colour
B+	B+		red

There's a specific thing about the connection of ARE6149P regulator. The figure 30 @D_23_IMG_046_DIAGRAM_regulator-ARE6149P_fig30 illustrates only the terminal F which we connect with the bench output FLD1. The bench output FLD2 shall be connected to the terminal B- since one of the relay brushes is permanently connected to В- while the excitation winding coil is being controlled through the brush connected to the alternator 'positive' (B-circuit breaking type).

8.2. Voltage regulator test menu
The diagnostic screen of voltage regulators may display the following information, which differs from the alternator testing mode, see Fig. 31 @D_23_IMG_047_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-test-mode-menu_fig31:
Figure 31. Voltage regulator test mode menu @D_23_IMG_047_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-test-mode-menu_fig31

1 - Control of the output voltage stabilization of the regulator, if it provides voltage regulation capability.
2 - Measured value of stabilization voltage.
3 - Buttons simulating the alternator rotor rotation frequency for the regulator.

8.3. Diagnostics
1. Connect the regulator to the test stand following the methodology (examples) described in section 8.1.
2. In the regulator type selection menu, choose the nominal voltage of the regulator under test: 12V or 24V, and the corresponding regulator type.
3. If the regulator has terminals A, IG, or 15, activate button K15.
  3.1. For COM type regulators, wait for data reading. After values appear in the cells: "ID", "Version LIN", "Type", you can proceed with further diagnostics.
4. Evaluate the operability of the control lamp by setting the speed to 0 (zero) - the red battery discharge indicator should light up. Increase the speed above 800 - 1200 rpm - the control lamp indicator should turn off.
  4.1. For COM type regulators, set the speed value to "0" (zero), the "ERRORS" cell should display the value "M". When the speed value increases above 800 - 1200, the "M" value in the "ERRORS" cell should disappear.
5. Increase the speed to maximum and evaluate the regulator's ability to adjust to the specified stabilization voltage.
  5.1. Change the set stabilization voltage from minimum to maximum, the measured stabilization voltage value should change proportionally to the set value.
  5.2. For LAMP type regulators, voltage regulation is not provided; it should be set within the range of 14 to 14.8 V for 12 V regulators, and 28 to 29.8 V for 24 V regulators.
  5.3. For C JAPAN type regulators, set the set stabilization voltage to "OFF" mode - the measured stabilization voltage should be equal to the battery voltage. Then set the set stabilization voltage to "ON" mode - the measured stabilization voltage should be within the range of 14 to 14.7 V.
6. If the regulator has an S terminal, check its operability. Press the "Test sense pin" button, the stabilization voltage should increase. Press the "Test sense pin" button again - the stabilization voltage should return to its previous value.
7. Failure to meet any of the requirements in points 4 - 6 indicates a regulator malfunction. For COM type regulators, if the "ERRORS" cell displays "E" or "T", it also indicates a regulator malfunction.
8. Exit the diagnostic mode by pressing the "BACK" button. Disconnect the wires from the regulator.

9. TEST BENCH MAINTENANCE
The bench is designed for a long operation life and doesn't have any special maintenance requirements. At the same time, to ensure the maximum operation life, the regular monitoring of bench technical condition should be made as follows:
