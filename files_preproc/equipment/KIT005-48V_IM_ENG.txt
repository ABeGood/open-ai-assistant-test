MS005 TEST BENCH UPGRADE KIT FOR TESTING 48 V BELT STARTER GENERATORS (BSG) @D_0_IMG_000_PHOTO_MS005-TEST-BENCH-UPGRADE-KIT_general-view

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

INTRODUCTION
Thank you for choosing the product of MSG Equipment.
The KIT005-48V kit is designed to upgrade the MS005 bench that lacks the mode for testing 48V belt starter-generators (MS005 benches manufactured before September 2023).
The installation of the kit allows the MS005 bench to:
1) Test belt starter-generators in both generator and starter modes of operation.
2) Read data from the control unit of the 48V starter-generator using a diagnostic scanner.

Before performing the installation works, carefully study this instruction.

Upgrade steps include:
1) Mounting the 48V power supply unit.
2) Connecting the 48V power supply unit to the electrical system of the bench.
3) Updating the bench's software and activating the 48V starter-generator testing function.

3. Install mounting brackets for securing the power supply unit. 
- Attach the brackets to the inner partition of the housing using M6 nuts.
- When installing, position the brackets to the extreme holes according to figure 3.

Connecting the RSP-3000-48 power supply unit to the bench's electrical system.
Three sets of wires are connected to the RSP-3000-48 power supply unit (see figure 6 @D_0_IMG_007_PHOTO_Connecting-power-supply-unit-to-MS005-bench_fig6):
1 – Power supply wires of the power supply unit.
2 – Control wires for the power supply unit.
3 – Power supply output wires.

4. Connect the power supply wires of the power supply unit  (pos. 1, fig. 6 @D_0_IMG_007_PHOTO_Connecting-power-supply-unit-to-MS005-bench_fig6) to the power terminal block (see fig. 10 @D_0_IMG_013_PHOTO_Connect-power-supply-wires-of-power-supply-unit_fig10).
Figure 10 @D_0_IMG_013_PHOTO_Connect-power-supply-wires-of-power-supply-unit_fig10

4.1. Remove the blue transparent cover of the terminal block.
4.2. Connect the wires to the locations shown in the diagram 11 @D_0_IMG_014_PHOTO_Connect-power-supply-wires-of-power-supply-unit_fig11. The places where wires of the corresponding color should be connected are highlighted.
