2. Keep the workspace clean and well-lit. Clutter and poorly lit areas can lead to accidents.
3. When operating the machine, use personal protective equipment for the eyes and hands, such as safety glasses and gloves.
4. For electrical and fire safety, DO NOT:
Connect the machine to a power supply with faulty or missing overload protection.
Operate the machine if it is malfunctioning.
Repair or modify the machine yourself.
5. The room where the machine is installed must be equipped with local exhaust ventilation.
6. Memorize the location of the emergency stop button so you can use it quickly if necessary.
7. Always securely clamp the workpiece in the machine.
8. Ensure the workpiece is mounted without runout.
9. Always remove the chuck key after installing the workpiece.

5.2. Machine preparation for operation 
The machine is delivered packaged. Remove the packaging materials. The packaging is fully recyclable; collect and dispose of it in designated recycling areas.
After unpacking, ensure the machine is intact and undamaged. If any damage is found, contact the manufacturer or authorized dealer before turning on the machine.
Place the machine on a firm, flat, horizontal surface. During installation and relocation, handle the machine by its frame only.
Before operating the machine:
1. Connect the 400 V power supply using the socket provided with the machine. Follow the markings (L1, L2, L3, N, PE) inside the socket to ensure correct wiring to the power network.
2. Ground the machine frame.

6. POLISHING THE STEERING RACK ROD 
The procedure for operating the machine, using the example of polishing a steering rack rod, is as follows:
1. Install the steering rack rod into the chuck and tighten the chuck jaws using the supplied key.
2. Rotate the handwheel to bring the tailstock with the taper so that the taper fits into the taper hole at the end of the rod. Securely tighten the chuck jaws and the handwheel.
3. Lower the chuck guard. Turn on the machine by rotating button 4 and press the “START” button to activate the drive.
4. Wrap a strip of sandpaper around the workpiece (see Fig. 2).
WARNING! Be careful not to touch the rotating workpiece.
