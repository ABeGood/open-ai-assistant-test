3. Disconnect all connectors from the "head" at the front (as shown in the diagram @D_15_IMG_004_PHOTO_head-connector-disconnection-front_step3) and the rear @D_15_IMG_005_PHOTO_head-connector-disconnection-rear_step3, after first unscrewing the D-SUB connector mounting screws with a PH1 screwdriver.
The round shiny connector, not shown in the photo, must also be disconnected and will no longer be used in the new configuration.
