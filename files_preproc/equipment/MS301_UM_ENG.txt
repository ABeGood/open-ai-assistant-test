6.4) Set the mode switch to the "0" position. The bench is now ready for operation.

6. BRAKE CALIPER DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of the brake caliper is performed in the following sequence:
1. Select a fitting or a combination of a fitting and adapter that matches the caliper thread.
Figure 8. Connector and adapter matched to caliper threads @D_29_IMG_008_PHOTO_connector-adapter-selection_fig8
2. Screw the fitting into the caliper and tighten it with a wrench. The tightening torque should be:
- for the fitting - moderate, as the sealing will occur due to the rubber-metal ring;
- for the fitting with an adapter - the same as on the vehicle, as the sealing will occur metal-to-metal.
Figure 9. Installing the coupling with adapter on the caliper @D_29_IMG_009_PHOTO_coupling-adapter-installation_fig9
3. Turn the pressure release valve to the "OPEN" position, then connect the high-pressure hose to the fitting.
Figure 10. Connecting the high-pressure hose @D_29_IMG_010_PHOTO_high-pressure-hose-connection_fig10

4. Loosen the bleed fitting on the brake caliper by 1/4 or 1/2 turn, then attach a transparent bleed tube to it.
Figure 11. Connected PVC tube for pumping @D_29_IMG_011_PHOTO_pvc-tube-connection_fig11
5. Install a stopper for the caliper piston to prevent it from falling out. For this, you can use a metal object of the appropriate size, such as the metal part of a hammer.
Figure 12. Installing the piston stop @D_29_IMG_012_PHOTO_piston-stop-installation_fig12

6. Bleed the brake caliper:
6.1. Turn on the "PUMP" mode. Wait until the fluid starts to flow out of the PVC tube, then turn the pressure release valve to the "CLOSED" position.
6.2. Wait until fluid flows through the tube without bubbles, then tighten the bleed fitting on the brake caliper.
6.3. During bleeding, hold the piston stopper by hand until the piston extends and presses against it.
Figure 13. Tightening the pumping connection @D_29_IMG_013_PHOTO_pumping-connection-tightening_fig13
WARNING! If the piston does not press against the stopper during bleeding, activate the high-pressure mode several times until the piston presses against the stopper.
6.4. Remove the bleed tube from the fitting. The brake caliper is ready for testing.
7. Conduct the test.
7.1. Activate the "INCREASE PRESSURE" mode and wait for the working pressure to be established on the pressure gauge. Turn off the "INCREASE PRESSURE" mode and set the mode switch to the "0" position.
7.2. Leave the caliper under pressure for some time (no more than 30 seconds) and monitor for any pressure drop and fluid leaks. The presence of fluid leaks and pressure drop as indicated by the gauge signifies a faulty caliper.
7.3. Release the pressure from the caliper - turn the pressure release valve to the "OPEN" position, then disconnect the high-pressure hose and unscrew the fitting from the caliper.

7. TEST BENCH MAINTENANCE
The bench is designed for long-term operation and does not have special maintenance requirements. However, for maximum trouble-free operation, it is necessary to regularly monitor its technical condition, namely:
• Tightness of the hydraulic system (visual inspection);
• Condition of the working fluid - assessed visually by appearance. It should be clear, homogeneous, and without sediment.
• Replace the fine filter (model PP-5SL, filtration rating 5-20 microns) every 6 months.

7.1. Replacing the fine filter
The fine filter of the bench is replaced in the following sequence:
1. Turn on the bench.
2. Connect any of the fittings to the high-pressure hose and submerge it in a container for collecting used working fluid.
3. Turn the pressure release valve to the "CLOSED" position. Then activate the "PUMP" mode, and the working fluid will flow from the tank into the container.
Figure 14 @D_29_IMG_014_PHOTO_fluid-drainage-setup_fig14
4. Drain the fluid until the "TANK MIN" indicator lights up. Then set the mode switch to the "0" position and the pressure release valve to the "OPEN" position.
5. Remove the back panel of the bench by unscrewing the screws around the perimeter.
Figure 15 @D_29_IMG_015_PHOTO_back-panel-removal_fig15-1 @D_29_IMG_016_PHOTO_back-panel-removal_fig15-2
6. Activate the drain tray mode by setting the mode switch to the "DRAIN" position. Pump the fluid out of the filter flask until the fluid level is minimal.
Figure 16 @D_29_IMG_017_PHOTO_filter-flask-drainage_fig16

7. Unscrew the filter flask and replace the filter cartridge with a new one (model PP-5SL, filtration rating 5-20 microns).
