6. DIAGNOSTICS OF 12/24 V ALTERNATOS
The following common diagnostic steps are provided for all types of 12/24 V alternators:
1. Installation of the alternator on the bench and its fixation.
2. Installation of the belt on the pulley and its tensioning.
3. Connection of power wires to the alternator. For convenient connection, an adapter should be screwed onto the positive terminal of the alternator for the connection of the power terminal B+.
4. Connect the diagnostic cable to the terminals in the alternator socket.
5. Select the appropriate parameters for the alternator test.
6. Diagnosis of the alternator.
7. Dismounting the unit from the bench.

6.1. Installation and de-installation of the alternator
1. Use the "Release Chain" button to increase the length of the chain sufficient for securing the alternator. A single press increases the length of the chain, and a subsequent press stops this process.
2. Position the alternator on the working platform so that the pulley is directly above the belt.
3. Place the chain on the alternator and secure the end of the chain on the bench. Then use the "Tighten Chain" button to tension the chain; the bench will automatically stop the chain tensioning process.

CAUTION! Be careful not to injure your fingers.

4. Use the "Release Belt" button to loosen the belt enough to fit it onto the alternator pulley. A single press loosens the belt, and a subsequent press stops this process.
5. Use the "Tighten Belt" button to tension the belt. The bench will automatically stop the tensioning process.

CAUTION! Ensure that the position of the chain on the alternator is such that after tightening the belt, the alternator is in a horizontal position (see Fig. 14 @D_22_IMG_021_PHOTO_alternator-installation-fixation_fig14). Misalignment of the alternator leads to belt slippage on the pulley and rapid wear.
Figure 14. Installation and Fixation of the Alternator on the Bench @D_22_IMG_021_PHOTO_alternator-installation-fixation_fig14

6. Screw the adapter onto the "B+" terminal (see Fig. 15 @D_22_IMG_022_PHOTO_adapter-B-plus-terminal_fig15).
Figure 15 @D_22_IMG_022_PHOTO_adapter-B-plus-terminal_fig15

7. Connect the black power wire "B-" to the unit's housing and the red power wire "B+" to the adapter (see Fig. 16 @D_22_IMG_023_PHOTO_power-wires-connection-alternator_fig16).
Figure 16. Connection of Power Wires to the Alternator @D_22_IMG_023_PHOTO_power-wires-connection-alternator_fig16

8. After diagnosis, disassembly of the alternator is performed in reverse order.
WARNING! Disassembly of the alternator is allowed only after the drive has completely stopped, and the testing mode has been exited.

6.2. Connecting the diagnostic cable to the alternator connector
To assess the operability of the alternator, it is necessary to select an appropriate special cable or correctly connect the universal cable to the terminals in the alternator socket.
To select a special cable, go to the alternator database (see Fig. 17 @D_22_IMG_024_DIAGRAM_alternator-database-search_fig17). Using the original alternator number, which is often located on the housing or rear cover, search for the alternator in the "Search" tab.
ATTENTION! Diagnostics of alternators: Valeo "Stop-Start" 12 V system (alternator type IStars), "I-ELOOP" (Mazda) and alternators without voltage regulator (alternator type F/67), is possible only using a special cable (see appendix 1).
Figure 17 @D_22_IMG_024_DIAGRAM_alternator-database-search_fig17

If the desired alternator is in the bench's database, its type, main characteristics, photo, connection terminal designations, and the number of the required cable will be displayed. If the desired alternator is in the bench's database, its type, main characteristics, photo, connection terminal designations, and the number of the required cable will be displayed.
Connect the special cable to the bench and the alternator, after which you can proceed with the diagnosis.
Figure 18 @D_22_IMG_025_PHOTO_special-cable-connection_fig18

To connect the universal cable, first find the designation of the terminals in the alternator connector on the internet. Then identify the alternator connector terminals to determine the alternator type using the information in appendix 1. When connecting the wires of the universal cable to the terminals in the alternator connector, also refer to appendix 1.
As an example, let's consider connecting the universal cable to the Bosch 0986049191 alternator (Fig. 19 @D_22_IMG_026_PHOTO_bosch-alternator_fig19 @D_22_IMG_027_DIAGRAM_bosch-terminal-designations_fig19).

WARNING! If the alternator pulley has a freewheel clutch, carefully select the direction of rotation.
  3.3. Visually assess whether the alternator rotates normally. If there are noises or vibrations from the alternator indicating mechanical malfunction or incorrect alternator installation, stop the diagnostics by pressing the "Cancel" button.
  3.4. To continue the diagnostics, press the "Ok" button.
4. Evaluate the operation of the voltage regulator according to the following criteria:
  4.1. If the diagnosed alternator is of the COM or IStars 12V type, the bench should identify the alternator's ID, COM speed, and TYPE, and the Errors indicator should display a message about mechanical malfunction "MEC".
  4.2. If the alternator has a control lamp, the indicator of the control lamp should light up (see item 1 in Figure 23 @D_22_IMG_033_DIAGRAM_alternator-test-mode-menu_fig23).
5. Conduct a check to determine at what RPM the alternator starts generating, for this:
WARNING! For alternators with a voltage regulator terminal labeled "A" or "IG" or "15", activate the "K15" button.
  5.1. Gradually increase the speed using the alternator drive control buttons until the output 5.1 For alternators that have a control lamp indicator, it goes out at the moment of generation start.
  5.2 For alternators without control lamp indicator, the moment of generation start is determined at the moment of establishment of operating voltage from 13.9 to 14.8 V for 12V alternators, and from 28 to 29.8 V for 24V alternators.
  5.3 For alternators of COM or IStars 12V type, the mechanical error disappears at the moment of generation start.
6. Evaluate the operation of the voltage regulator by:
  6.1. Setting the drive speed within 1500-2000 rpm.
  6.2 (For Lamp-type alternators without output voltage control, this step is not required). Using the output voltage control buttons (see item 6 in Figure 23 @D_22_IMG_033_DIAGRAM_alternator-test-mode-menu_fig23), smoothly adjust the alternator's output voltage within the range from minimum to maximum. The measured voltage should change proportionally.
  6.3. For C JAPAN type alternators, set the stabilization voltage setting to "OFF" mode - the measured stabilization voltage should be equal to the battery voltage. Then set the stabilization voltage setting to "ON" mode - the measured stabilization voltage should be within 14 to 14.7 V.
7. Evaluate the alternator's performance under load by:
  7.1. Setting the drive speed within 2500-3000 rpm.
  7.2. Setting the generation voltage within 14 to 14.8 V. For C JAPAN type alternators, switch to the "ON" mode.
  7.3. Smoothly increase the load on the alternator while the value of output voltage should remain constant and the value of alternating current in the circuit B+ "I, AC" should not exceed 10% of the value of the set load (for example, with a load of 50A the value of "I, AC" should not exceed 5A). Also, the current oscillogram should not show large peaks, the values should fluctuate within the same limits.
    To determine the technical condition of the alternator, it is sufficient to set a load from 50 to 80 A.
8. For IStars 12V type alternators, perform a check of its operation in starter mode by:
  8.1. Stopping the alternator drive.
  8.2. Pressing the "Starter" button to start the test mode, during which the alternator should reach the idle speed of the engine.
9. To complete the alternator diagnostics, stop the alternator drive and then exit the test mode. After that, the alternator can be removed from the bench.
10. Failure to comply with any of the requirements in points 4 - 8.2 indicates a fault in the alternator.

6.5. Diagnostics of alternators without voltage regulator
The diagnosis of alternators without voltage regulators is performed using the MS-33042 (42A) cable. The sequence of operations is as follows:
1. Fix the alternator on the bench. Put the belt on the pulley and tension the belt.
2. Connect the MS-33042 (42A) cable to the alternator according to Table 5.

  4.3. To continue the diagnosis, press the "Ok" button.
5. Conduct a check at which speed alternator begins, for this smoothly increase the drive speed until the output voltage increases and becomes equal to 13.9 to 14.8 V.
6. Evaluate alternator performance under load by:
  6.1. Set the drive speed within the range of 2500 - 3000 rpm.
  6.2. Smoothly increase the load on the alternator, while the output voltage value should remain constant and the value of alternating current in circuit B+ "I, AC" should not exceed 10% of the set load value. Also, the current oscillogram should not show large peaks, the values should fluctuate within the same limits.
7. To complete the alternator diagnostics, stop the alternator drive and then exit the test mode. The alternator can then be removed from the bench.
8. Failure to fulfill one of the requirements of paragraphs. 5 - 6.2 indicates a faulty alternator winding.
