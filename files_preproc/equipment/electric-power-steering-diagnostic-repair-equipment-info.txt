Title: Equipment for Diagnostics and Repair of Electric Power Steering (EPS) Systems | MSG Equipment
Description: Professional testers, adapters and stands for EPS diagnostics. Comprehensive equipment for repair of steering racks and columns with electric power steering.

Equipment for Diagnostics and Repair of Electric Power Steering (EPS) Systems
Modern vehicles are predominantly equipped with electric power steering (EPS) systems that provide comfortable control and enhanced driving safety. Like any automotive component, electric power steering requires periodic diagnostics and maintenance to maintain optimal technical condition. MSG Equipment develops and manufactures specialized equipment for professional diagnostics and repair of various EPS system components.

Types of Equipment for Electric Power Steering Diagnostics and Repair
The equipment line for working with electric power steering systems includes various devices providing a comprehensive approach to diagnostics and repair:
• Mechanism for steering rack diagnostics under load
• Tester for checking dismounted EPS units
• Adapter for diagnosing steering racks without control unit
• Work table for steering mechanism electronics repair
• Cable and connector sets for connection to various unit types

Functional Capabilities of Electric Power Steering Testing and Repair Equipment
Mechanisms for steering rack diagnostics under load provide resistance to rack rod movement, simulating load from vehicle wheel turning. This allows identification of malfunctions that manifest only under resistance. Such equipment provides maximum rod load up to 250 kg and operates at air pressure from 2 to 10 bar.
The tester for electric power steering diagnostics is designed for checking EPS units dismounted from vehicles: steering racks, columns and pumps. This equipment works with various data transmission protocols: CAN, CAN-FD, FlexRay, as well as with PWM-controlled units. The tester simulates working conditions for the electric power steering system, allowing it to operate separately from the electrical system and obtain necessary diagnostic information: current consumption, live data from the control unit, DTC error list with clearing capability.
Adapters for diagnosing steering racks without control units expand tester capabilities and allow diagnostics of units controlled by external blocks. During diagnostics, the adapter provides testing of the electric motor, position sensor, torque sensor and mechanical part of the steering rack with real-time parameter display. It also allows torque sensor calibration, which is important for correct EPS operation.
The electronics repair table provides organized workspace specifically designed for working with EPS components. It is equipped with built-in laboratory power supplies with adjustable parameters, specialized lighting for high-precision assembly work and necessary outlets for connecting diagnostic equipment. The ergonomic design of such tables increases work productivity and accuracy of electronic component repair operations.

Technical Capabilities of EPS Diagnostics and Repair Equipment
Professional diagnostic equipment for electric power steering systems has a wide range of technical capabilities:
• Flash memory programming for clearing difficult-to-remove errors
• Parameter loading for preparing racks for specific vehicles
• Identification data changes for various control unit types
• Erasing rack binding to specific vehicles
• EEPROM data reading and writing
• Software recovery of faulty control units
• Dynamic CAN bus indication for tracking connection integrity
• Unit database search by original part numbers
• Connector pinout display for correct connection
• Non-standard diagnostic connector pinout configuration
• Unit diagnostics with maximum current consumption up to 100A
• Simulation of various operating modes: ignition on, engine running, movement at various speeds

The EPS tester is regularly updated, allowing expansion of the supported unit database and addition of new diagnostic functions. Equipment is equipped with protection against short circuit, overload and overheating, ensuring safe work with expensive components.

Workstations for EPS Electronics Repair
The work table for steering mechanism electronics repair represents a comprehensive solution for organizing efficient workspace. Such tables are equipped with laboratory power supplies with adjustable output voltage from 0 to 22V and current from 0 to 5A. High-precision parameter adjustment with 0.01V and 0.001A steps ensures safe work with sensitive EPS electronics.
A feature of the workspace is an integrated lighting system creating illumination in the work area of at least 750 lux, meeting standards for high-precision assembly work. The work table is equipped with sufficient outlets for connecting diagnostic and repair equipment, improving work convenience.

Applications of EPS Testing and Repair Equipment
Specialized equipment for electric power steering diagnostics and repair is in demand in various automotive service sectors:
• Multi-profile auto services maintaining modern vehicles with EPS
• Specialized workshops for steering mechanism repair
• Dealer centers performing warranty service
• Manufacturers and rebuilders of steering racks and columns
• Training centers for preparing specialists in modern vehicle repair

Recommendations for EPS Diagnostics and Repair Equipment Selection
When selecting diagnostic equipment for electric power steering work, it is recommended to consider auto service specialization and types of serviced vehicles. For full-service operations, an optimal solution would be a comprehensive equipment set including testers for dismounted unit diagnostics, load testing mechanisms and specialized workstations.
An important factor is regular diagnostic equipment software updates, which expand the supported unit database and add new functional capabilities. This allows auto services to adapt to technical changes and new electric power steering models appearing in the market.
