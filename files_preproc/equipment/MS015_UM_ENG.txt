– Stabilizing voltage;
–The frequency and the duty cycle through the terminal FR - the voltage regulator feedback that demonstrates the rate of the activated rotor winding coil condition.
For COM alternators:
– ID;
– Protocol;
– data exchange speed;
– regulator self-diagnostics errors.

4 – alternator output voltage - measured.
COM PR. – voltage regulator protocol. The following protocols are displayed: LIN1.3 (on screen - LIN1), LIN2.0 (on screen - LIN2).
ID – voltage regulator identification number. It’s a unique number of the receiver of the commands from the engine control unit. When installing a new alternator into a car, it’s important that ID corresponded to the original one, otherwise, a car won’t “accept” the unit, and the control unit will indicate the alternator error.
COM SPEED – data transmission speed, between the voltage regulator and the car electronic control unit. At LIN protocol, the following the speed rates can be displayed:
• L – 2400 Bd (low);
• M – 9600 Bd (medium);
• H – 19200 Bd (high).
TYPE – voltage regulator connection type. The name of the protocol BSS is displayed, as well as 12 types of LIN protocol: A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C3, D1, D2, E1.
EXCITATION – current value in the winding coil of alternator excitation. This parameter is read from the voltage regulator by LIN protocol (the parameter is displayed in %).
ERRORS – indicator of errors that the regulator transmits to engine control unit. The following errors may happen:
• EL – electric;
• МЕС – mechanic;
• ТН – overheating.
Once the error is detected, it’s highlighted by red.
SUPPLIER – the voltage regulator manufacturer.
SUPP. ID – the voltage regulator ID generated by the manufacturer.
BACK – exit from the diagnostics mode.

When you choose the mode of the diagnostics of the following alternator types: SIG, RLO, RVC, C KOREA, P/D, C JAP. alternator types, the following information can be displayed (fig. 8):

5. APPROPRIATE USE
1. Use the tester for the specified purpose only (see section 1).
2. When using the tester, consider the following maintenance restrictive guidelines:
2.1. The tester should be used at the temperature range from +5 °С up to +40 °С and the relative humidity range from 10 up to 75% without moisture condensation.
2.2. Do not use the tester at the low temperature and high humidity (more than 75%). When the tester is brought from the cold place (outdoors) into the warm place, the condensate can appear on its elements. Thus, do not turn on the tester at once. Wait for 30 minutes until switching it on.
2.3. Keep the tester far from the direct sunlight.
3. Do not keep the tester close to the heaters, microwave ovens and other equipment that generates a high temperature.
4. Protect the tester from the falling, and make sure that any technical liquids won’t get it.
5. Any changes in the tester electric circuit are forbidden.
6. When the cable is connected to the alternator terminals, the crocodile clips should be isolated completely.
7. Avoid the mutual short circuit of the crocodile clips, and to any current-conducting car part including the car body.
8. Disconnect the tester once the diagnostics is completed.
9. In case of failures in the operation of the tester, stop further operation and contact the manufacturer or sales representative.
WARNING! The manufacturer is not responsible for any damage or injury to human health resulting from non-compliance with the requirements of this user manual.
WARNING! When using tester touch-screen, do not press much.  DO NOT USE any stylus pen or other objects to press the touch-screen. Keep the tester away from the sharp and hard objects.

5.1. Safety guidelines
The tester has to be operated by the qualified persons who got the access to operate the definite bench (tester) types and who were instructed on the safe operating procedures and methods.

5.2. Alternator diagnostics procedure
The alternator diagnostics procedure is carried out as follows:
1. Referring to the alternator OEM, that is commonly indicated on the body or rear cover, find on the Internet the information on the alternator connector terminals.
2. Use the information in the Appendix 1 to determine the regulator type referring to the connector terminals.
3. Connect the tester to the alternator referring to the colour codes specified in p. 4. The tester is power supplied by alternator battery. Once the tester is on, the main menu will be displayed.
4. Choose the relevant alternator type in the tester menu and press TEST. The tester does into diagnostics mode.
4.1. If the tested alternator has COM connection terminal, wait until the tester identifies ID and TYPE of alternator.
5. Start the cat engine and cut off all the load. Wait until the engine runs smoothly at idle.
WARNING! It’s forbidden to exit the diagnostic mode while the engine runs because it will result in the extreme power surge generated by the alternator.

WARNING! If one of the black (B-, battery negative) and/or the red (B+, battery positive) crocodile clips has spontaneously disconnected, it’s forbidden to connect it back while the engine runs.

5.1. The stabilization voltage rate shall become equal to 13.8V with the possible deviation ±0.2V.
5.2. For C JAPAN alternators, the stabilization voltage rate shall be within 12.1 and 12.7V.
6. Change the alternator voltage value by the buttons –V or +V within 13.2 and 14.8V. The measure voltage should change respectively, with the possible deviation ±0.2V.
6.1. For C JAPAN alternator, press the buttons -V or +V to change the alternator operation mode to ON. The stabilization voltage rate shall be within 14 and 14.4V.
7. Set any alternator voltage value by the buttons -V, +V within 13.2 and 14.8V. Increase the rotation frequency of the engine crankshaft to the medium rpm. At the same time, the voltage value on the tester should not change (the deviation ±0.2V is acceptable).
8. Without decreasing the engine crankshaft rpm, increase the alternator load by switching on the headlights, seat heating, windshield heating and other electric power consumers. The voltage value though should not change (the acceptable voltage drop - by 0.3V).
9. Stop the engine.
10. Disconnect the tester terminals.
11. Failure to comply with the one of the paragraphs 4.1, 5.1 – 8 indicates the alternator failures.

6. TESTER MAINTENANCE 
The tester is designed for a long-tern operation and doesn’t require the maintenance, however, control the following things:
• If the operation environment is appropriate (temperature, humidity, etc.).
• If the diagnostic cable is in order (visual inspection).

6.1. Software update
To update the tester software, you’ll need 32GB MicroSD card formatted to the file system FAT32.
The updating is made as follows:
- Download the file with the latest software version that you can find on the website servicems.eu in the MS015 product description.
- Copy the file ‘MS015Update.bin’ to the root directory of MicroSD card.
 WARNING! There should be just one file - ‘MS015Update.bin’ - on the MicroSD card.
- Switch off the tester and insert MicroSD card into the tester slot.
- Switch on the tester connecting the red and black crocodile clips of the tester to the battery or to 12V power source.
- When starting, the tester will automatically discover the software new version and install it.
- Wait until the installation completed.
 WARNING! It’s forbidden to terminate the updating of the software by switching the tester off, or by extracting MicroSD card.
- Once the download is completed, the tester will restart.
- Switch off the tester.
- Remove MicroSD card.
- The tester is ready for operation.

6.2. Cleaning and care 
To clean the surface of the tester, use soft wipes or a rag, using neutral cleaning agents. The display should be cleaned with a special fiber wipe and monitor screen cleaning spray. Do not use abrasives or solvents to avoid failure or damage to the tester body.
