EQUIPMENT FOR DIAGNOSTICS OF AUTOMOTIVE STARTERS AND GENERATORS

Starter and generator repair occupies an important place in the automotive service market for several objective reasons. Restoration of these units is economically feasible for vehicle owners, and properly repaired components match the reliability of new components. For efficient repair, precise equipment for starter and generator diagnostics is necessary, allowing identification of specific malfunctions. Failures in these systems occur regularly due to aggressive environmental factors, natural wear and violations of vehicle operating modes.
A modern automotive generator is a complex unit integrated into the onboard system via digital bus and functioning according to various control protocols. Quality diagnostics of such generators is impossible without professional equipment for generator testing. Starter design, although remaining more conservative, also requires specialized stands for starter diagnostics, providing accurate assessment of electrical components, including the electric motor and solenoid.

Comprehensive Equipment for Starter and Generator Diagnostics
MSG Equipment has developed a line of specialized diagnostic equipment divided into three functional areas:
• Equipment for express diagnostics of starters and generators on vehicles - allows determination of unit functionality without dismounting and assessment of the need for removal to identify the cause of malfunction and subsequent repair
• Stands for diagnostics of dismounted starters and generators - allow identification of faulty unit components and control testing after repair to confirm work quality
• Testers for diagnostics of individual starter and generator components - designed for testing diode bridges, stator windings, generator voltage regulators and starter solenoids

Features of Diagnostic Equipment for Starters and Generators
MSG Equipment diagnostic stands provide comprehensive testing of a wide range of automotive units: generators with various control systems, including start-stop systems and mild hybrids, starters of different power ratings, voltage relay regulators. Equipment for generator testing allows assessment of their operation under various loads and in different modes. Testers for relay regulators provide precise diagnostics of control electronics, while specialized equipment for automotive starter-generator diagnostics allows work with modern hybrid systems.
Modern models of stands for generator and starter testing are equipped with electrical parameter visualization functions in the form of real-time oscillograms, ensuring maximally accurate determination of malfunction nature. Software for specialized diagnostic equipment is regularly updated, guaranteeing stand relevance throughout the entire service life.
Testers for checking individual components, including equipment for testing generator diode bridges, allow component diagnostics without multiple assembly and disassembly of units, significantly reducing repair time and increasing efficiency. Equipment for starter testing and generator express diagnostic systems provide the ability to assess their technical condition both on the vehicle and in dismounted form.

Technical Capabilities of Starter and Generator Diagnostic Equipment
Professional MSG Equipment diagnostic stands for starter and generator testing allow comprehensive diagnostics of:
• Generators with nominal voltage of 12V, 24V and 48V
