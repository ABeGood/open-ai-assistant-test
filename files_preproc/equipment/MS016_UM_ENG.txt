5. APPROPRIATE USE
1. Use the tester as intended (see Section 1).
2. The tester is designed for indoor use. Be aware of the following operating constraints:
2.1. The tester should be used in the spaces equipped at the temperature range from +10 °C up to +40 °C and the relative humidity range from 10 up to 75% without moisture condensation.
2.2. Do not use the tester at the low temperature and high humidity (more than 75%). When the tester is brought from the cold place (outdoors) into the warm place, the condensate can appear on its elements. Thus, do not turn on the tester at once. Wait for 30 minutes until switching it on.
3. Keep the tester far from the direct sunlight.
4. Keep away from heating devices, microwaves, and other temperature-raising equipment.
5. Avoid dropping the tester or spilling technical liquids on it.
6. Any interference with the electric diagram of the device is strictly prohibited.
7. Make sure the crocodile clips are completely insulated before connecting them to the alternator/voltage regulator terminals.
8. Avoid the crocodile clips short circuit between themselves or to any conductive parts of a vehicle, including its body.
9. Do not put the tester on the vehicle battery or other elements of the underhood space. Avoid short circuit of the tester housing to the conductive parts of a vehicle.
10. Do not use the device with a faulty power unit.
11. Turn off the tester when it is not in operation.
12. In case of failures in the operation of the tester, stop further operation and contact the manufacturer or sales representative.
WARNING! The manufacturer is not responsible for any damage or injury to human health resulting from non-compliance with the requirements of this user manual.

5.1. Safety guidelines
Only specially trained personnel who have been authorized to work on specific types of stands (instruments) and have undergone instruction on safe practices and methods may work with the tester.

5.2. Mode of operation
Mode 1 - Powered from a power unit.
Testing voltage regulators with a nominal voltage of 12/24V requires the use of a power unit: either the one included in the equipment set or any other power unit with the "Quick Charge 2.0" function. In this mode, the supply voltage (9V) will be displayed at the top of the tester screen. When the tester is powered from a 5V power unit, the only available test mode is for 12V units.
WARNING! The operation of some voltage regulators requires heavy current that the tester cannot provide. The diagnosis of such voltage regulators is not possible.
Mode 2 - Powered from a vehicle power system.
Use a diagnostic cable for alternators included in the equipment set (Fig.6 @D_30_IMG_015_PHOTO_diagnostic-cable-alternators_fig6). The tester will switch on and function in alternator test mode only when we connect big crocodile clips "B+" and "B-" to the alternator output terminals.
Mode 3 - Connecting to a computer.
When we connect the tester to a computer via a USB Type-C port, it operates in a data transmit receive mode. In this mode, a new bootloader, software, and database versions can be uploaded to the device memory. Also, it is possible to read information stored in the tester memory.

6. VOLTAGE REGULATOR TESTING
Generally, most voltage regulators are tested as follows:
1) Connection of a voltage regulator to the tester;
2) Selection of the type and nominal voltage of the tested voltage regulator;
3) Assessment of the control lamp operability: when speed is about 0 rpm, the battery indicator must light up (red). As the speed increases up to 800-1200 rpm, the indicator must go out.
4) Assessment of the "S" terminal operability;
5) Assessment of the voltage regulator capability to adjust to the preset stabilizing voltage. Use a cursor (Fig.10 @D_30_IMG_023_PHOTO_diagnostic-screen-information_fig10, n.1) to set the voltage.
WARNING! The test mode (Fig.9 @D_30_IMG_020_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-selection-menu_fig9-1 @D_30_IMG_021_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-selection-menu_fig9-2) should correspond to the type of the tested voltage regulator.
Connect both cable MS-33502 and a power unit equipped with "Quick Charge 2.0" to the tester through USB Type-C port to launch the diagnostic procedure.
WARNING! If the connected power unit doesn't feature "Quick Charge 2.0", the tester can test 12V voltage regulators only.
WARNING! Operation of some TM Bosch voltage regulators requires a heavy current, the tester cannot deliver. Voltage regulators of this type cannot be tested.
6.1. Voltage regulator connection
Assessment of the voltage regulator operability requires a proper connection of the diagnostic cable to the voltage regulator.
Use the voltage regulator OEM number to search the terminal markings against the database (Fig.17 @D_30_IMG_037_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-database-search_fig17 @D_30_IMG_038_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-database-search_fig17).
Figure 17. Voltage regulator search against the database and search results @D_30_IMG_037_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-database-search_fig17 @D_30_IMG_038_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-database-search_fig17

Connect the diagnostic cable to the voltage regulator as shown on the diagram.
WARNING! To avoid damage (failure) to the voltage regulator, extra care should be taken when connecting the cable clips to the contacts in the terminals. Use either a well-insulated clip (Fig.18 @D_30_IMG_039_PHOTO_well-insulated-clip_fig18 @D_30_IMG_040_PHOTO_clip-connect-to-terminals_fig18) or a proper adapter cable (Fig.5 @D_30_IMG_005_PHOTO_adapter-cables-voltage-regulators_fig5).
Figure 18 - Connection of cable clips to the contacts in the terminals @D_30_IMG_039_PHOTO_well-insulated-clip_fig18 @D_30_IMG_040_PHOTO_clip-connect-to-terminals_fig18

When the connection is made, press "OK" - the tester will automatically switch over to the test mode appropriate for the tested voltage regulator. Then, proceed to the voltage regulator testing (the process is described below).
If the information on the markings of the voltage regulator terminals cannot be found in the database, research online. Appendix 3 is yet another source of information. There you can find connection diagrams of the most common voltage regulator types. Use the diagram with terminal markings found online and the examples below to connect the diagnostic cable.
Figure 19 shows a diagram (an example) for connection of voltage regulator ARE1054.
Figure 19 - Voltage regulator ARE1054 @D_30_IMG_041_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-are1054_fig19

Identify the type of the voltage regulator by the terminal contacts shown in Fig.19 @D_30_IMG_041_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-are1054_fig19 and use information set out in Appendices 1, 2 of the actual Instruction. Shown here are terminals DFM and L(RVC) (can also be marked as L(PWM)). By terminal L (RVC) we identify this voltage regulator as RVC type.
Then, using Appendix 1, we determine which clips (connectors) of the diagnostic cable must be connected to the voltage regulator. A diagram of voltage regulator ARE1054 connection to the tester is shown both in Table 2 and Figure 20.

Figure 21 shows a diagram of voltage regulator ARE6076 connection as an example.
Figure 21. Voltage regulator ARE6076 @D_30_IMG_043_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-are6076_fig21

The voltage regulator type is identified by the terminal contacts and based on the information set out in Appendices 1, 2. In the example given, terminals IG, S, FR(M) do not identify the type of the voltage regulator. Terminal L identifies it as a Lamp type.
Then we refer to Appendix 1 to determine which clips (connectors) of the diagnostic cable must be connected to the voltage regulator. The connection diagram of voltage regulator ARE6076 is shown in both Table 3 and Figure 22.

Table 3. Connection of voltage regulator ARE6076 to the tester

Figure 22. Diagram of voltage regulator ARE6076 connection to the tester @D_30_IMG_035_DIAGRAM_are6076-connection-diagram_fig22

Connection of voltage regulator ARE6076 has a specific feature. There is only one terminal shown in Figure 21 - terminal F, to which we connect cable F1. The other green cable (F2) must be connected to terminal B+, since one of the brushes is permanently connected to B+ while the excitation winding is controlled through the brush connected to the alternator negative terminal (A-circuit type).

Figure 23 shows the connection diagram of voltage regulator ARE6149P as an example.

Figure 23. Voltage regulator ARE6149P @D_30_IMG_042_DIAGRAM_voltage-regulator-are6149p_fig23

The voltage regulator type is identified by terminal contacts and based on the information set out in Appendices 1, 2. There is only one terminal - LIN, which identifies this voltage regulator as COM type.

Consult Appendix 1 to determine which clips (connectors) of the diagnostic cable must be connected to the voltage regulator. The diagram of voltage regulator ARE6149P connection to the tester is shown in both Table 4 and Figure 24.

Table 4 - Connection of voltage regulator ARE6149P to the tester
Voltage regulator terminal	Tester output terminal	Color marking of cable
B+	B+	red

Ps	ST1	blue
LIN	GC	yellow
G	B-	black
G	F2	green

Connection of voltage regulator ARE6149P has a specific feature. We connect cable F1 to the only terminal - F. As the actual voltage regulator is B-circuit type, the other cable (F2) must be connected to terminal B-. Consequently, one of the brushes is permanently connected to B- of the alternator, while the excitation winding is controlled through terminal B+.

2. Connect the tester to the alternator observing the markings of cable MS-33501 (see Section 1). Follow the instructions set out in Appendix 1.
2.1. Connect a cable clip "B+" to a positive terminal of the alternator and a cable clip "B-" - either to the alternator body or to the battery negative terminal. Powered by a battery, the tester will be on and the main menu will be displayed.
2.2. Connect the appropriate clips of cable MS-33501 to the pins of the alternator terminals.
3. In the tester menu select the test mode for alternators (Fig.7 @D_30_IMG_016_PHOTO_tester-main-menu_fig7, n.3) and then, select the alternator type (Fig.9 @D_30_IMG_020_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-selection-menu_fig9-1 @D_30_IMG_021_PHOTO_voltage-regulator-selection-menu_fig9-2). The tester will switch over to the test mode.
3.1 (This does not apply to the alternators of SIG and P/D types) Upon activation of the test mode, the control lamp indicator must light up.
3.2 If this is the alternator with COM terminal, wait for the tester to readout the data. As soon as the values appear in ID, Version LIN, and Type boxes, proceed to testing.
4. Start the vehicle engine and turn the load off. Wait for it to run steadily at idle speed. The stabilizing voltage shall set at 13.8V, the allowable deviation is ±0,2V.
4.1 The stabilizing voltage for Lamp-type alternators must set as follows: for 12V alternators - in the range from 14 to 14.8 volts, for 48V alternators - from 28 to 29.8 volts.
4.2 The stabilizing voltage for alternators of C JAPAN type must set in the range from 14 to 14.5 volts.
5 (This does not apply to Lamp-type alternators). Change the stabilizing voltage in the range from 13.2 to 14.8 volts. The measured voltage must vary in proportion.
5.1 When testing alternators of C JAPAN type, switch the preset stabilizing voltage to OFF. The measured stabilizing voltage must set in the range from 12 to 12.7 volts.
6. Set the alternator voltage in the range from 13.2 to 14.8 volts. For C JAPAN alternators, switch the preset voltage to ON. Increase the engine crankshaft rotation speed to medium. The measured voltage must not change (the deviation by ±0,2V, is within the norm).
7. Without reducing the engine crankshaft speed, increase the load on the alternator by switching on headlights and other lights. The voltage must not change (the voltage can reduce no more than by 0.3V from the preset one).
8. Stop the engine.
9. For "Start-stop" 12V alternators, conduct a check of its operation in starter mode, for this:
9.1. Press the "Starter" button to start the test mode, during which the generator pulley should begin to rotate. We recommend limiting the duration of the test to 5 seconds.
9.2. Press the "Starter" button again to stop the testing process.
10. Exit diagnostic mode. Disconnect the clamps from the alternator.
11. Failure to perform as described in sub-items 2.1, 3-7 indicates the voltage regulator malfunction.
WARNING! Test alternators either outdoors or in premises equipped either with a supply-and-extract ventilation or an exhaust system.

A connection diagram for Valeo IST60C017 is shown as an example in Fig.25 @D_30_IMG_049_DIAGRAM_valeo-ist60c017_fig25 @D_30_IMG_050_DIAGRAM_valeo-ist60c017-terminal-markings_fig25.

ATTENTION! When diagnosing 12V "Start-Stop" system alternators, it is necessary to use the MS-33502 cable (see fig. 4 @D_30_IMG_004_PHOTO_diagnostic-cable-voltage-regulators_fig4).
