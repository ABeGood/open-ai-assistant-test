USER MANUAL


INTRODUCTION
We appreciate you have chosen the products of TM MSG Equipment.
This User Manual provides information on using the MS-33503A cable and the MS016 tester to record diagnostic parameters when starting a car engine to determine the technical condition of the starter.

1. APPLICATION
The MS-33503A cable is designed to work in conjunction with the MS016 tester and is intended for diagnosing the starter of a car without removing it or on a stand that secures and powers it. 
The MS016 tester, when used with the MS-33503A cable, allows you to record voltage values on the starter terminals: 31, 30, 45, and current on terminal 30 during engine start. The results of these measurements are displayed on the tester screen in the form of a graph. This information helps identify deviations in the starter's operation, the car's battery, or the wiring.

2. CABLE DESCRIPTION
The MS-33503A cable (see Figure 1) includes three crocodile clips and one current sensor, which are connected to the starter terminals as shown in Figure 2.

The MS-33503A cable is color-coded as follows:
• Red clip "30" - connects to the starter's terminal 30, which is connected to the car's battery positive terminal.
• Black clip "31" - ground, connects to the starter's casing.
• Yellow clip "45" - connects to the starter solenoid terminal, where the power wire to the starter motor is connected.
The current sensor is placed on the power wire that connects to terminal 30.

3. MS016 TESTER MENU FOR STARTER DIAGNOSTICS

To activate the starter diagnostic mode, you need to connect the MS-33503A cable to the MS016 tester and provide power to the tester. The tester is powered either from the power supply included in the MS016 tester kit or from a portable power bank.

In starter diagnostic mode, the tester screen displays the following information (see Figure 3):
1 – Graph display area with measurement results.
2 – Buttons for scaling the graph on the time scale.
3 – Buttons for displaying graphs:
B+ – voltage change on the starter terminal 30 (car battery positive);
DC – current change on the starter terminal 30;
AC – change in the magnitude of alternating current on the starter terminal 30;
mV – measurement of voltage drop on the starter solenoid.
4 – The ">0<" button calibrates the tester.

4. STARTER DIAGNOSIS
Starter diagnosis proceeds as follows:
1. Connect the MS-33503A cable to the MS016 tester and provide power to the tester through the USB port.
2. After turning on and entering the starter diagnostic mode, connect the K30 (red) and K45 (yellow) crocodile clips and press the ">0<" button.
3. Connect the diagnostic cable clips to the starter terminals. Place the current sensor on the power wire connected to terminal 30 of the starter, ensuring that the arrow on the sensor's inner part (see Figure 4) is pointed towards the starter.

4. Start the car engine for about 5 seconds and then turn it off.
5. Wait for the tester to display measurement results.

Clicking on the graph shows the values of all parameters at a given time.
6. By analyzing the voltage and current change graphs, you can assess the technical condition of the starter and identify potential issues, such as:
Significant voltage drop on terminal 30 indicates a weak car battery.
Significant voltage drop on terminal 45 indicates a faulty starter solenoid.
Strong current fluctuations on the graph suggest issues with the starter motor.
If the starter current significantly exceeds the nominal value with moderate voltage drop on terminal 30, this indicates a problem with the car's engine.
If the starter current is below the nominal value with a significant voltage drop on terminal 30, this indicates poor wiring.
A high AC value indicates excessive brush sparking, which may be caused by an armature fault or severe brush wear.
