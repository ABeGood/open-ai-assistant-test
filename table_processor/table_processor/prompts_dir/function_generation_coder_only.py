    generate_code_gpt4_ = """You are highly proficient with Python and the pandas library. A user has submitted a query that you need to address: '{input}'. 
You also have a list of subtasks that need to be completed.

A pandas DataFrame named `df` has been provided. It has already been defined and populated with the necessary data, so there is no need to load or recreate it.
The output of `print(df.head({head_number}))` is:
{df_head}

Please pay close attention to the descriptions of the columns in the DataFrame:
{column_description}


Your task is to define a Python function named `def solve(df):` that fulfills the user's query and returns the result of the analysis.
Include all necessary import statements at the beginning of the code.
Use backticks to enclose the code.
Only include visualizations if the user's query explicitly requests them (e.g., plot, chart).
Do not test the function with commands like `print(solve(df))`; only define the function. Avoid including code descriptions or usage examples.
Ensure not to check the instance type against `int` or `float`; use `Number` instead.
Be cautious of data orderâ€”avoid changing it through operations like sorting.
Do not use `reset_index()`. Leave the DataFrame index unaltered after processing.
Before returning the result in the `solve` function, remove all auxiliary or temporary columns (e.g., a 'delta' column).
Be cautious of NaN, Inf and other special values - the table contains few of them.
Avoid using pd.DataFrame.reset_index() method, it may cause failure in our unittests.

Here are examples of the output format:

Example 1 (top five selection - ordering does not matter):
```python
import pandas as pd

def solve(df):
    # Sort the DataFrame `df` in descending order based on the 'happiness_index' column.
    sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='happiness_index', ascending=False)

    # Extract the top 5 rows from the sorted DataFrame.
    top_five = sorted_df.head(5)

    # Create a list of the 'Country' column from these rows.
    countries = top_five['Country'].tolist()

    # Return the list of countries.
    return countries
```

Example 2 (top five selection - ordering does matter):
```
import pandas as pd

def solve(df):
    # select top 5, keep the current order
    top_five = df.nlargest(5, 'happiness_index')
    
    # Create a list of the 'Country' column from these rows.
    countries = top_five['Country'].tolist()
    
    # Return the list of countries.
    return countries
```

Example 3:
```python
import pandas as pd

def solve(df):
    # Filter the DataFrame `df` for entries where the 'age' column is greater than 30.
    filtered_df = df[df['age'] > 30]

    # Calculate the average 'salary' for these entries.
    average_salary = filtered_df['salary'].mean()

    # Return the average salary.
    return average_salary
```

i.e. in general, the format of your output must be
```python
<code>
```
The <code> must follow pep8 rules and must be syntactically correct! Do not use '`' character in <code> string.
