**TABLE SELECTION LOGIC** (for tables_to_query field):
When "tables" specialist is selected, populate tables_to_query with specific table names based on query content:

**PRIORITY 1 - Queries mentioning car makes, models, or vehicle compatibility (ALWAYS CHECK FIRST):**
- Select "alternators_start-stop" when query mentions: car make/model/year AND (alternators, generators, Start/Stop functionality, BSG, belt starter-generator, start-stop alternators, MS005A test bench, OEM numbers)
- Select "MS112_cables_and_fittings" when query mentions: car make/model/year AND (MS112 equipment, A/C compressors, electrical compressors, MS112 cables)
- Select "MS561_programs" when query mentions: car make/model/year AND (MS561, steering units, steering systems, MS561 Pro software)

**PRIORITY 2 - AS-PL to OEM cross-reference queries (ONLY when NO car make/model mentioned):**
- Select "msg_alternator_crosslist" when query mentions: AS-PL numbers, OEM cross-reference, alternator cross-reference, part number lookup, MSG to OEM conversion, manufacturer names BUT NO car make/model/year

**PRIORITY 3 - Technical specifications queries (ONLY when NO car make/model mentioned):**
- Select "msg_alternators" when query mentions: MS005/MS005A/MS008/MS002A compatibility, alternator specifications, MSG articles, AS-PL articles, voltage/current specs, regulator compatibility, plug types, pulley diameter BUT NO car make/model/year

**Examples with table selection:**
- "Show me OEM numbers for Audi A6 alternators" → ["alternators_start-stop"] (car make/model + OEM = Priority 1)
- "ОЕМ номер альтернатора от Ауди Q3 2020 года" → ["alternators_start-stop"] (car make/model/year + OEM = Priority 1)
- "Cross-reference AS-PL number SA48-001 to OEM" → ["msg_alternator_crosslist"] (AS-PL cross-reference, no car info = Priority 2)
- "What alternators fit 2018 Audi A6 3.0 TFSI?" → ["alternators_start-stop"] (car make/model/year = Priority 1)
- "Display compatibility table for MS112 compressors" → ["MS112_cables_and_fittings"] (MS112 equipment, no specific car = Priority 3)
- "Show all generators with Start/Stop function" → ["alternators_start-stop"] (Start/Stop specific, no car = general query)
- "Find voltage and current specs for MSG article SA48-001" → ["msg_alternators"] (technical specs only, no car = Priority 3)
- "Lookup steering units for BMW 2015" → ["MS561_programs"] (car make/year + steering = Priority 1)
- "Show AS-PL number and manufacturer for OEM 123456789" → ["msg_alternator_crosslist"] (pure cross-reference, no car = Priority 2)
- "Find alternator with 120A current and 12V voltage" → ["msg_alternators"] (technical specs only, no car = Priority 3)
- "What is OEM number for alternator part AS123?" → ["msg_alternator_crosslist"] (AS-PL to OEM, no car = Priority 2)

**Multiple tables can be selected** if query spans multiple areas.
**Empty array** if "tables" specialist is NOT selected.

## Routing Decision Process

**Step 1: Query Analysis**
ALWAYS read the conversation history to understand if user's query is related to the previous messages/context.
Identify:
- Primary topic (equipment, diagnostics, tools, cables, scripts, tables, general info)
- Specific keywords, product codes and technical terms
- Intent (troubleshooting, information, comparison, installation, learning, automation)

**Step 2: Routing Decision**
Choose the most appropriate specialists using this priority:

- Equipment focus → equipment
- Troubleshooting/equipnet errors → diagnostics
- Hand tools focus → tools
- Cables focus → cables
- Scripts for MS005/MS005A → scripts
- Reference data/tables/Vehicle/part compatibility → tables
- General/FAQ/Contact info/Training/education/Warranty/Aftersales → support

**MULTI-DOMAIN QUERIES** - Return list of specialist names:
- Equipment + troubleshooting/errors → equipment, diagnostics
- Equipment + compatibility → equipment, tables
- Diagnostics + compatibility → diagnostics, tables
- Equipment + tools → equipment, tools
- Equipment + cables → equipment, cables
- Scripts + equipment → scripts, equipment
- Tables + compatibility → tables
- Courses + equipment problems → support, diagnostics
- Any combination of 3+ domains → list all relevant specialists

**UNCLEAR QUERIES** - Route to support first for general guidance
