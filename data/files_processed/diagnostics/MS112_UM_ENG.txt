MS112 TEST BENCH FOR DIAGNOSTICS OF ELECTRIC COMPRESSORS OF AUTOMOTIVE AIR CONDITIONERS @D_33_IMG_000_PHOTO_ms112-test-bench-general-view

DIAGNOSTICS MANUAL

6. DIAGNOSIS OF THE COMPRESSOR
The diagnosis procedure consists of the following steps:
1. In the test bench's database, find and select the model of the unit you want to diagnose. The test bench will indicate the numbers of the cables and connectors required for its diagnosis.
2. Connect the connectors to the compressor and secure them (see Figure 12 @D_33_IMG_018_PHOTO_compressor-connector-installation_fig12).
2.1. If an "EXPRESS TEST" is to be performed to check the compressor's electric motor, the connectors can be omitted.
Figure 12 @D_33_IMG_018_PHOTO_compressor-connector-installation_fig12
3. Secure the unit on the test bench (see Figure 13 @D_33_IMG_019_PHOTO_compressor-test-setup_fig13).
4. Connect the high-voltage cable and the data cable to the compressor. Attach the "crocodile" clamp of the high-voltage cable to the compressor's body (see Figure 13 @D_33_IMG_019_PHOTO_compressor-test-setup_fig13).

5. Connect the high-pressure and low-pressure hoses (see Figure 13 @D_33_IMG_019_PHOTO_compressor-test-setup_fig13).

6. Start the "FULL TEST" or "EXPRESS TEST". After this, touching the metal parts of the test bench or the compressor is FORBIDDEN.
6.1. If you started the "FULL TEST," the diagnostic process will run automatically. Upon completion, the screen will display the results of the measurements or the reasons for test interruption (see Table 3 and 4).
6.2. If you started the "EXPRESS TEST," you should stop the process by pressing the "STOP" button.
7. Upon completing the compressor diagnosis, you can remove it from the test bench.

6.1. Possible issues during compressor diagnosis and their solutions
To obtain accurate results, it's important that the compressor has the correct amount of oil. Excess or insufficient oil can lead to erroneous test results. Before testing, it's recommended to pour 30 ml (cm3) of oil into the LP hose of the compressor. The oil type is indicated on the compressor's label.
Because nitrogen doesn't mix with the compressor oil, the oil tends to accumulate in the cavity of the front cover of the compressor, behind the valve plate (Figure 14 @D_33_IMG_020_DIAGRAM_compressor-oil-accumulation_fig14). This is especially relevant for Denso compressors.

Figure 14 @D_33_IMG_020_DIAGRAM_compressor-oil-accumulation_fig14

The test might fail, and the test bench will display one of the messages: "The compressor is not building pressure" or "Poor compressor performance." If this happens, try one of the two actions described below and repeat the test.

Option 1
Conduct the compressor test in a vertical position as shown in Figure 15 @D_33_IMG_021_PHOTO_vertical-test-position_fig15.
Figure 15 @D_33_IMG_021_PHOTO_vertical-test-position_fig15

Option 2
Dismount the compressor from the test bench.
Unscrew the safety valve on the compressor and drain the oil into a clean container (Figure 16 @D_33_IMG_022_PHOTO_oil-draining-procedure_fig16-1 @D_33_IMG_023_PHOTO_oil-draining-procedure_fig16-2). Then screw the safety valve back into place.

Figure 16 @D_33_IMG_022_PHOTO_oil-draining-procedure_fig16-1 @D_33_IMG_023_PHOTO_oil-draining-procedure_fig16-2

Next, unscrew the fitting from the LP line and pour approximately 30 ml (cm3) of oil into it. The oil type is indicated on the compressor's label.
Install and secure the fitting. Afterward, place the compressor back on the test bench and repeat the test.

7. TEST BENCH MAINTENANCE
The test bench is designed for long-term operation and has no special maintenance requirements. The need for maintenance will be indicated by an appropriate message. The maintenance procedure involves three stages (see section 7.1 for details):
• Draining the separated compressor oil.
• Replacing the combined 10" filter.
• Replacing the filtering element in the Certools F701 filter (KN-701).

In addition to periodic maintenance, it's necessary to regularly inspect its technical condition, namely:
• Checking for any unusual sounds.
• Inspecting the condition of cables and quick-connect fittings (visual inspection).

7.1. Periodical service maintenance
Regular maintenance of the test bench is carried out as follows:
1. Disconnect the test bench from the electrical power supply.
2. Unscrew all screws on the rear panel and remove it.
3. Disconnect the sensor connector (see item 4 in Figure 17 @D_33_IMG_024_PHOTO_maintenance-elements-location_fig17) located on the compressor oil collection container, item 2 in Figure 17 @D_33_IMG_024_PHOTO_maintenance-elements-location_fig17.
3.1. Unscrew the container bulb and drain the oil into a disposal container.
3.2. Screw the container bulb back and reconnect the sensor connector.
4. Unscrew the container bulb with the combined 10" filter (item 3 in Figure 17 @D_33_IMG_024_PHOTO_maintenance-elements-location_fig17). Replace the filter and screw the bulb back.
5. Using an adjustable wrench or socket, rotate the Certools F-701 filter cover (item 1 in Figure 17 @D_33_IMG_024_PHOTO_maintenance-elements-location_fig17) counterclockwise to disconnect it from the filter bowl.
5.1. Assess the condition of the sealing rings. Replace them if necessary.
5.2. Replace the filtering element.
5.3. Place the filter cover back and screw it clockwise.
6. Reinstall the rear panel and secure it with screws.

1 - Certools F-701 filter; 
2 - oil separator; 
3 - combined 10" filter; 
4 - sensor connector for used oil level control.

7.2. Pressure release from the test bench
In the event of an abnormal situation (test bench malfunction) during compressor diagnosis, it is necessary to release the pressure from the test bench before performing repair work.
To release the pressure, follow these steps:
1. Remove the rear panel of the test bench.
2. Connect the manifold hose to the service port (ensure the fitting has a depressor installed), see Figure 18 @D_33_IMG_025_PHOTO_pressure-release-procedure_fig18-1 @D_33_IMG_026_PHOTO_pressure-release-procedure_fig18-2.
3. Slowly open the valve on the manifold and release excess pressure from the system.
4. Disconnect the manifold from the service port and screw the rear panel of the test bench back into place.
WARNING! If the manifold is not available, you can depress the valve using a screwdriver. In this case, wrap the service port with a rag to prevent oil splatter.
