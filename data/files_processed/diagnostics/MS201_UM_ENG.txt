DIAGNOSTICS MANUAL

5.2. Test bench mounting and setup
The test bench is delivered in packaging. Unpack the test bench and make sure it has no damages. Packaging materials are fully recyclable and should be wasted separately from domestic garbage.
Position the test bench upright (use a leveling gauge) on the level floor. When moving the test bench, do not hold it by its movable or perforated parts. Put vibration-absorbing pads under the test bench legs.
Keep the distance of at least 0.5 meters between the test bench and the room walls or any other objects. The test bench ensures safe operation in the temperature range between +10 °С and +40 °С and relative humidity of 10-90% (without water condensation).

Before launching the test bench, connect it as follows:
1. Electrical network (400V): Use the socket included with the bench for connection. Follow the internal markings (L1, L2, L3, N, PE) when connecting the socket to the power supply network.
2. Pneumatic line with a pressure of 6 to 8 bar.

6. SHOCK ABSORBER DIAGNOSIS
6.1. Preparing the test bench and shock absorber for mounting
Install one of the sets of fixtures (see Figure 2) corresponding to the shock absorber attachment type into the lower pneumatic clamp (see Figure 16 @D_17_IMG_018_DIAGRAM_shock-absorber-mount-types_fig16). If the upper shock absorber attachment has a threaded part, screw the prism onto it (see Figure 3 @D_17_IMG_003_PHOTO_universal-prisms-for-fixing-shock-absorbers_fig3).
Figure 16. Types of shock absorber mounts and a combination of devices for mounting them on the bench @D_17_IMG_018_DIAGRAM_shock-absorber-mount-types_fig16

To replace the shock absorber fixation device in the lower pneumatic clamp, it is necessary to unscrew the mounting screw pos.6 fig. 5 @D_17_IMG_005_PHOTO_test-compartment_fig5 and pull out the device. Next, set the device to stop and spin the installation screw.

6.2. Mounting the shock absorber on the test bench
The shock absorber shall be mounted on the bench in the following sequence:
1. Turn on the bench.
2. Pull the shaft out of the shock absorber to the maximum value.
3. Place and fix the shock absorber in the upper clamp with the shaft up, for this:
3.1 Position the top mounting of the shock absorber (prism) coaxially with the pneumatic clamp pushers (see fig. 18 @D_17_IMG_021_PHOTO_correct-pneumatic-clamp-pusher-position_fig18) and «Clamp» it.
3.2. Alternately rotating pushers (see pos.5 of Figure.4) position the shock absorber so that its shaft is located in the middle of the pneumatic clamp (Fig. 19 @D_17_IMG_022_PHOTO_shock-absorber-positioning-in-clamp_fig19). It is necessary to control the correct positioning of the cams (see pos. 1. fig. 4 @D_17_IMG_004_PHOTO_MS201-test-bench-main-components_fig4), they must be fully extended (see fig. 20 @D_17_IMG_023_PHOTO_pneumatic-clip-cams-incorrect-position_fig20a @D_17_IMG_024_PHOTO_pneumatic-clip-cams-correct-position_fig20b).

WARNING! Improper fixing of shock absorbers in pneumatic clamps is the most common cause of the test bench malfunction.

6.3. Recording shock absorber characteristics
The working diagram of the shock absorber helps identify any deviations in its operation. Recording the working diagram is done with the piston's movement ranging from 50 to 100 mm. The temperature of the shock absorber before testing should be between 15 and 30 °C.
The sequence of operations, is as follows:
1. On the main screen, press the "Test turnover" button and then "Sensor calibration" (see position 2, Figure 12 @D_17_IMG_012_DIAGRAM_bench-main-menu_fig12). After this, diagnostic modes become active.
WARNING! During the test turnover, the operator's hand should be on the emergency shutdown button to instantly stop the bench's engine in case of an emergency.
2. Before recording the working diagram, perform at least four cycles of shock absorber pumping at a frequency of oscillations from 10 to 30 cycles/min. To do this, activate the "Manual mode." In this menu, use the "+" button (see position 4, Figure 15 @D_17_IMG_017_DIAGRAM_manual-mode-menu_fig15) to set the required frequency of oscillations. After completing the desired number of cycles, stop the bench's drive with the "Stop" button.
3. Activate the "Automatic mode." Then, go to the settings of this mode using the "Settings" button. In this menu, set parameters such as frequency of oscillations and duration for each stage. The maximum piston speed parameter is informational and is calculated automatically. To change the value, press the field with the value, delete the current value using the keyboard, and then enter the new one. The established sequence of operations can be saved and reused in the future.
Figure 26. Setup menu for recording the working diagram of the shock absorber @D_17_IMG_030_DIAGRAM_setup-menu-recording-working-diagram_fig26

3.1. For a more objective assessment of the shock absorber's condition, check its operation with closed and opening rebound and compression valves.
3.2. Record the working diagram with closed valves at a maximum piston speed within the range of 0.08 to 0.20 m/s, corresponding to frequencies of:
- 31 to 95 cycles/min with a piston stroke of 50 mm;
- 20 to 47 cycles/min with a piston stroke of 100 mm
3.3. Record the working diagram with opening rebound and compression valves at a maximum piston speed within the range of 0.25 to 0.52 m/s, corresponding to frequencies of:
- 95 to 180 cycles/min with a piston stroke of 50 mm;
- 47 to 98 cycles/min with a piston stroke of 100 mm.
4. During the recording of the working diagram, pay attention to the sounds produced by the shock absorber. Knocking, squeaking, and other noises are not allowed. "Hissing" caused by fluid leakage through the valves is acceptable.
5. During the recording of the working diagram, fluid leakage through the rod seals (aside from the inevitable lubrication of the sliding surfaces) is not allowed. Fluid leakage indicates a faulty shock absorber.
6. After completing all recording stages, the bench's drive will stop. Save the recorded diagram by (see Figure 27 @D_17_IMG_031_DIAGRAM_bench-settings-menu_fig27): 
Accessing the corresponding menu;
Specifying the storage location (position 1);
Creating a new folder if needed (position 2) by entering the folder name and pressing the "Add" button;
Entering the result name (position 3) and pressing the "Add" button.

1 – Path to saved results.
2 – Field for entering a new folder name.
3 – Field for entering a new result name.
4 – Buttons for creating or deleting a result (folder).
5 – Field for searching saved results.
6 – Button to call the on-screen keyboard.

7. The assessment of the shock absorber's condition is performed by comparing the obtained working diagram with a reference diagram recorded from a new shock absorber of the same manufacturer.
The process of comparing results is carried out in the "Testing results" menu (see Figure 28 @D_17_IMG_032_DIAGRAM_diagnostic-results-comparison-screen_fig28). Use buttons "1," "2," and "3" to select the displayed graphs.
A shock absorber is considered functional if the deviations in resistance forces from the values of the reference sample (new shock absorber) are within ±15% for rebound and ±20% for compression. Additionally, the diagram's characteristics should be similar.
Figure 28. Diagnostic results comparison screen @D_17_IMG_032_DIAGRAM_diagnostic-results-comparison-screen_fig28

7. DIAGNOSIS OF ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED SHOCK ABSORBERS
The bench allows testing the functionality of electronically controlled shock absorbers using the MS203 adapter. The adapter provides the ability to manually control one or two solenoid valves of the shock absorber. The adapter can adjust the degree of solenoid valve opening from 10% to 95%.

7.1. Description of the MS203 Adapter
The adapter has the following connectors (see Fig. 29 @D_17_IMG_034_PHOTO_MS203-adapter-appearance_fig29): 
1 – USB connector for communication with the bench.
2 – Power connector (type 5.5 x 2.5 mm).
3 – Connector for connecting diagnostic cables.
Figure 29. Appearance of the adapter @D_17_IMG_034_PHOTO_MS203-adapter-appearance_fig29

The adapter kit includes five special cables and one universal cable, which are designed to connect the adapter to the solenoid valves of the shock absorber being tested. Each special cable (see Fig. 30 @D_17_IMG_034_PHOTO_special-cable-connectors_fig30) is equipped with a connector for connection to the adapter (position 1) and a connector for connection to the unit under test (position 2).
Figure 30 @D_17_IMG_034_PHOTO_special-cable-connectors_fig30

The universal cable (see Fig. 31 @D_17_IMG_035_PHOTO_universal-cable-connectors_fig31) is equipped with a connector for connection to the adapter (position 2) and alligator clips (position 1).
Figure 31 @D_17_IMG_035_PHOTO_universal-cable-connectors_fig31

The universal cable has the following color coding:
Red – common positive contact;
Black and blue – PWM signal control of the solenoid valves.

The adapter should be connected to the bench in the following order:
1. Connect the adapter to the power supply unit included in the kit.
2. Connect the adapter's power supply unit to a single-phase 230V network.
3. Connect the adapter to the bench using a USB cable. After this, the "Manual Diagnosis" menu on the bench will display buttons for activating the solenoid valves and sliders for adjusting the valve opening degree (see Fig. 32 @D_17_IMG_037_DIAGRAM_manual-mode-menu-with-MS203-adapter_fig32).

7.2. Diagnostic Procedure
1. Install the shock absorber on the stand as described in section 6.2.
2. Connect the cable to the adapter, then to the shock absorber solenoid valve connector.
3. On the main menu screen press the "Test turnover" button and then "Sensor calibration" see item 2 fig. 12. 2 Fig. 12 @D_17_IMG_012_DIAGRAM_bench-main-menu_fig12. After that the diagnostic modes become active.
WARNING! During the test turnover, the operator's hand must be on the emergency shutdown button of the stand to immediately stop the bench's motor in case of an emergency.
4. Activate the "Manual mode" diagnostic mode.
5. Pump the shock absorber by performing at least four compression cycles at a frequency of 10 to 30 min⁻¹.
6. After pumping, set the compression frequency of the shock absorber to 95 to 180 min⁻¹.
7. Activate the solenoid valve(s) using the "Valve" button.
8. Gradually increase and decrease the degree of opening of the solenoid valve(s).
8.1 The functionality of the solenoid valve(s) is determined by the operating diagram graph, which should change proportionally to the valve(s) opening degree.
9. After completing the diagnostics, stop the stand drive, disconnect the cable from the shock absorber, and then it can be removed from the bench.

8.5. Gear motor inspection and maintenance
Perform the following maintenance procedures:
Every 500 hours of work or every month:
1) Inspect the gear motor visually for possible oil leakage.
2) Remove dust with a vacuum cleaner - the layer of dust accumulated on the gear motor cannot exceed 5mm thick.
Every 5 years:
Replace synthetic oil.
