MS301 TEST BENCH FOR DIAGNOSTICS OF BRAKE CALIPERS @D_29_IMG_000_PHOTO_ms301-test-bench_general-view

DIAGNOSTICS MANUAL

5.2. Preparing the bench for operation
The bench is delivered packaged. Unpack the bench. After unpacking, ensure that the bench is intact and free of any damage. If damage is found, contact the manufacturer or sales representative before turning on the bench.
The bench is designed for tabletop installation. When installing the bench, it must rest on its feet and be stable. For proper operation of the bench, ensure a tilt of 1° to 3° by adjusting the height of the feet by screwing them in or out (see Fig. 2 @D_29_IMG_002_PHOTO_bench-correct-position_fig2).

Before operating the bench:
1) Install the quick-release fitting in the designated place on the right side of the bench (see Fig. 3 @D_29_IMG_003_PHOTO_quick-disconnect-fitting-mounting_fig3).

2) Connect the electrical network to 230V (see Fig. 4 @D_29_IMG_004_PHOTO_electrical-air-connections_fig4).
3) Connect the compressed air source (see Fig. 4 @D_29_IMG_004_PHOTO_electrical-air-connections_fig4).

4) Insert the 6 mm and 8 mm PVC tubes into the holes in the drain tray cover, which have round holes of the appropriate size (see Fig. 5 @D_29_IMG_005_PHOTO_pvc-tubing-installation_fig5).

5) Fill the bench's tank with working fluid. To do this:
6.1) Turn on the bench.
6.2) Activate the DRAIN mode and pour 3.5 liters of brake fluid into the collection tray (see Fig. 6 @D_29_IMG_006_PHOTO_brake-fluid-filling_fig6).
Figure 6 @D_29_IMG_006_PHOTO_brake-fluid-filling_fig6
6.3) When the bench's tank is full, the TANK MAX indicator will light up, the bench will stop the draining process, and the mode switch backlight will turn off (see Fig. 7 @D_29_IMG_007_PHOTO_tank-max-indicator_fig7).
Figure 7 @D_29_IMG_007_PHOTO_tank-max-indicator_fig7
6.4) Set the mode switch to the "0" position. The bench is now ready for operation.

6. BRAKE CALIPER DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of the brake caliper is performed in the following sequence:
1. Select a fitting or a combination of a fitting and adapter that matches the caliper thread.
Figure 8. Connector and adapter matched to caliper threads @D_29_IMG_008_PHOTO_connector-adapter-selection_fig8
2. Screw the fitting into the caliper and tighten it with a wrench. The tightening torque should be:
- for the fitting - moderate, as the sealing will occur due to the rubber-metal ring;
- for the fitting with an adapter - the same as on the vehicle, as the sealing will occur metal-to-metal.

3. Turn the pressure release valve to the "OPEN" position, then connect the high-pressure hose to the fitting.

4. Loosen the bleed fitting on the brake caliper by 1/4 or 1/2 turn, then attach a transparent bleed tube to it.

5. Install a stopper for the caliper piston to prevent it from falling out. For this, you can use a metal object of the appropriate size, such as the metal part of a hammer.

6. Bleed the brake caliper:
6.1. Turn on the "PUMP" mode. Wait until the fluid starts to flow out of the PVC tube, then turn the pressure release valve to the "CLOSED" position.
6.2. Wait until fluid flows through the tube without bubbles, then tighten the bleed fitting on the brake caliper.
6.3. During bleeding, hold the piston stopper by hand until the piston extends and presses against it.

WARNING! If the piston does not press against the stopper during bleeding, activate the high-pressure mode several times until the piston presses against the stopper.
6.4. Remove the bleed tube from the fitting. The brake caliper is ready for testing.
7. Conduct the test.
7.1. Activate the "INCREASE PRESSURE" mode and wait for the working pressure to be established on the pressure gauge. Turn off the "INCREASE PRESSURE" mode and set the mode switch to the "0" position.
7.2. Leave the caliper under pressure for some time (no more than 30 seconds) and monitor for any pressure drop and fluid leaks. The presence of fluid leaks and pressure drop as indicated by the gauge signifies a faulty caliper.
7.3. Release the pressure from the caliper - turn the pressure release valve to the "OPEN" position, then disconnect the high-pressure hose and unscrew the fitting from the caliper.
