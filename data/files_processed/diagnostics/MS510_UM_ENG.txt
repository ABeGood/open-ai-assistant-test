DIAGNOSTICS MANUAL

6. POWER STEERING SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS
WARNING! When connecting the tester, ensure:
• the direction of fluid flow corresponds to the arrow on the tester body;
• the tightness of connections.
1. Connect the tester to the pump and the high-pressure mainline as shown in Fig. 2: @D_10_IMG_002_DIAGRAM_tester-connection-to-power-steering-system_fig2
- disconnect the high-pressure mainline from the pump;
- install transition fittings on the pump and mainline. 
2. Start the vehicle engine.
3. Sequentially perform 4 tests and based on the criteria outlined in Table 1, draw conclusions about the technical condition of the power steering system.
Test #1. Set valve 2 (Fig. 1) to position S. Measure the pressure in the vehicle's hydraulic system. 
Test #2. Briefly switch valve 2 to position P. The pressure gauge will show the maximum pressure generated by the pump.
WARNING! Do not switch valve 2 to position P for more than 5 seconds.

Test #3. Set valve 2 to position S. Turn the steering wheel to the extreme left or right position. Measure the pressure in the vehicle's hydraulic system.
WARNING! Do not hold the steering wheel in the extreme position for more than 5 seconds.
Test #4. Valve 2 in position S. Turn the steering wheel to the extreme left, then to the extreme right position. Measure the pressure in each position.
4. Turn off the vehicle engine. Disconnect the tester from the vehicle's power steering system.

Table 1: Main indicators for diagnostics of the power steering system
No. of Tests	Steering wheel position	Manometer parametrs	Defect
		Valve in position P	Valve in position S	
1	Central	-	Above normal	Line contamination. Steering rack defect
			Normal	No
2	Central	Below normal	-	Pump defect
		Normal		No
3	Maximum extreme position	–	Differs from test 2 normal position	Steering rack defect
			Equals test 2 normal position	No
4	Maximum left/right extreme position	–	Pressure differs in extreme left and right positions	Steering rack defect
			Pressure is equal in extreme left and right positions	No
* Normal position is the parameter of faultless power steering system of a particular car.
