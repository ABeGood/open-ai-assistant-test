MS503N TEST BENCH FOR DIAGNOSTICS AND FLUSHING OF POWER STEERING SYSTEM @D_31_IMG_000_PHOTO_ms503n-test-bench-general-view

DIAGNOSTICS MANUAL

5.2. Preparing the bench for operation
The bench is delivered packaged. Unpack the bench, remove the protective film from the display (if present). After unpacking, ensure that the bench is intact and free of any damage. If damage is found, contact the manufacturer or sales representative before turning on the bench.
Before operating the bench:
1) Pour in new ATF oil. Open the rear panel of the bench with a wrench and pour ATF oil into the tank through the filler neck (Fig. 4 @D_31_IMG_004_PHOTO_filler-neck-and-filter_fig4).
Figure 4. Filler neck 1 and filter 2 @D_31_IMG_004_PHOTO_filler-neck-and-filter_fig4
WARNING! To avoid malfunctions in the operation of the bench and diagnosed units, use only new ATF oil.
2) Connect the 230V electrical network.

7. POWER STEERING PUMP TEST
WARNING! Before starting the system flushing, it is necessary to ensure its integrity, check the fastening of all fittings, and secure the bench using the brake.
1. Connect the bench to the pump as indicated in Figure 6 @D_31_IMG_006_DIAGRAM_power-steering-pump-connection_fig6:
- Disconnect the high-pressure line from the pump;
- Connect the PUMP INPUT fitting of the bench to the pump;
- Connect the PUMP OUTPUT fitting of the bench to the high-pressure line.
1 - High-pressure line; 2 - PUMP OUTPUT fitting; 3 - PUMP INPUT fitting.
2. Set the PUMP OPEN/PUMP CLOSE valve to the PUMP OPEN position.
3. Start the vehicle engine.
4. Measure the fluid pressure readings at different engine speeds under different loads.

4.1. To create a load, slowly turn the PUMP OPEN/PUMP CLOSE valve towards the PUMP CLOSE position for several seconds.
Note: The pump load time should not exceed 10 seconds. Exceeding this parameter may result in fluid overheating and pump damage.
4.2. Based on the readings of gauge 7 and flowmeter 11 (Figure 2 @D_31_IMG_002_PHOTO_control-panel_fig2), and the criteria outlined in Table 1, draw conclusions about the pump's operation.
5. Turn off the vehicle engine. Disconnect the bench from the pump.

Table 1. Main indicators for diagnostics of the hydraulic power steering pump
Creating a load (imitate the rail in the extreme position, all the way to the stop)	Meter indication		Leak	Defect
	Flow	Pressure		
No	Minimal	Minimal	No	No
No	Minimal	Slight increase from the minimum	No	Deformation of sealing plate tearing of pump working section
No	After each load creation, the indicator changes	Maximum pump output	No	Wear out of operating steam (rotor with blades and working chamber). Wear out of bearing
Yes	No drop to minimum	No increase to maximum	No	Wear out of operating steam (rotor with blades and working chamber). Deformation of sealing plate tearing of pump working section
Cyclical	After each load creation, the indicator changes	No	No	Loss of bypass valve mobility, wear out of valve seat
Yes/No	No	No	Yes	Loss of bypass valve mobility
Yes/No	No	No	Yes	Wear out of seals, gaskets


8. POWER STEERING RACK TEST
The bench allows for checking the rack both when installed stationary on the vehicle and when removed from the vehicle. This instruction describes the inspection of a removed rack. The inspection of a rack installed on the vehicle is performed similarly.
WARNING! If the steering rack design includes shims under the steering tie rod, install them.
WARNING! Strictly observe the connection of high and low pressure. Incorrect connection leads to abrupt spontaneous rotation of the steering wheel shaft, which can cause injury.

1. Secure the rack in a vice.
2. Connect the bench to the rack as indicated in Figure 7 @D_31_IMG_007_DIAGRAM_steering-rack-connection_fig7:
- Disconnect the high and low-pressure lines from the steering rack;
- Connect the RACK INPUT fitting to the high-pressure line;
- Connect the RACK OUTPUT fitting to the low-pressure line.
3. Install limit stops or steering tie rods on the ends of the rack shaft.
4. Set the RACK CHECK/SYSTEM FLUSHING valve to the RACK CHECK position.
5. Turn on the bench's power, then activate the bench's pump using the PUMP button.
6. Measure pressure and fluid flow readings at different spool valve positions.
6.1. Move the rack shaft smoothly to the right/left by rotating the spool valve shaft until it stops, first putting locking pliers on it.
6.2. Based on the readings of gauge 7 and flowmeter 11 (Figure 2 @D_31_IMG_002_PHOTO_control-panel_fig2), and the criteria outlined in Table 2, draw conclusions about the condition of the steering rack.
7. Turn off the bench's pump and switch off the bench's power.
8. Disconnect the bench from the rack.


1 - High-pressure line; 
2 - Low-pressure line;
3 - RACK INPUT fitting; 
4 - RACK OUTPUT fitting.
