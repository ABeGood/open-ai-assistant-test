MS300 TEST BENCH FOR DIAGNOSTICS AND FLUSHING OF POWER STEERING SYSTEM @D_28_IMG_000_PHOTO_ms300-test-bench_general-view

DIAGNOSTICS MANUAL

5.2. Preparing the bench for operation
The bench is delivered packaged. Unpack the bench. After unpacking, ensure that the bench is intact and free of any damage. If damage is found, contact the manufacturer or sales representative before turning on the bench.
The bench is installed on a flat floor surface. The bench's design does not require it to be anchored to the foundation. The legs of the bench are equipped with height adjusters.
Before operating the bench, it is necessary to:
1) Connect to a 400V electrical network. Use the socket included with the bench, ensuring to follow the labeling inside: L1 L2 L3 N PE when connecting the socket to the power supply.
WARNING! After connecting the power to the bench, check the direction of the motor's rotation. Viewed from above, the impeller should rotate clockwise. If the rotation does not match the required direction, swap any two phases in the socket, such as L1 and L2.
2) Install the high-pressure hose.
3) Fill the bench's tank with working fluid. Pour 4 liters of brake fluid into the working fluid collection tray.

6. BRAKE CALIPER DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis of the brake caliper is performed in the following sequence:
1. Select a fitting that matches the caliper's thread.
2. Screw the fitting into the caliper and tighten it with a wrench.

3. Connect the high-pressure hose to the fitting.

4. Loosen the bleeder screw on the brake caliper by 1/4 or 1/2 turn, then attach a small transparent tube to it.
5. Install a support for the caliper piston to prevent it from falling out. You can use a metal object of the appropriate size, such as the metal part of a hammer.

6. Bleed the brake caliper as follows:
6.1. Briefly press the pressure application button. This may need to be done several times.
6.2. Wait until fluid flows through the tube without bubbles, then tighten the bleeder screw on the brake caliper. During bleeding, hold the piston support by hand until the piston extends and rests against it.
6.3. Remove the bleeding tube from the fitting. The brake caliper is now ready for inspection.
7. Perform a leak test:
7.1. Press and hold the pressure application button. Wait until the working pressure is established on the gauge, then release the button.
7.2. Leave the caliper under pressure for a short time (no more than 30 seconds) and monitor for pressure drop and fluid leakage. Evidence of fluid leakage and pressure drop on the gauge indicates a faulty caliper.
7.3. Release the pressure from the caliper using button 2 in Fig. 2 @D_28_IMG_002_DIAGRAM_control-panel_fig2, then disconnect the high-pressure hose and unscrew the fitting from the caliper.
8. If necessary, perform a test of the caliper's electric parking brake:
8.1. Using the wire set, connect the caliper's electric motor to the power terminals 7 (Fig. 2 @D_28_IMG_002_DIAGRAM_control-panel_fig2).

8.2. Place a metal bar or another hard object between the caliper body and the piston to prevent the piston from falling out of the body.
8.3. Turn on the 12V power by turning button 6 (Fig. 2 @D_28_IMG_002_DIAGRAM_control-panel_fig2). If the electric parking brake is functioning correctly, the caliper piston will extend and rest against the installed support.
WARNING! The engaged state of the electric parking brake must not exceed 30 sec.

8.4. Turn button 6 (Fig. 2 @D_28_IMG_002_DIAGRAM_control-panel_fig2) to reverse the polarity of the connection terminals. If the parking brake is functioning correctly, the piston will retract from the support and move back into the caliper.
