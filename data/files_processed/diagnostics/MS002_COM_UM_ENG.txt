2. Mount the unit on the working spot. The pulley shall be parallel to the used belt.
3. Fix the unit on the working spot, as follows:
WARNING! To activate the chain and belt tightening buttons it is necessary to enter the alternator test mode after switching on the stand and then exit it.
3.1. Press Chain release to loosen the chain to the required length.
3.2. Fix the chain to the shoulder in the working spot and press Tighten chain. The tightening will stop automatically.
4. Put the belt on the alternator pulley.
4.1. Press Belt release to add the required length of the belt. Put the belt on the alternator pulley and press Tighten belt.
4.2. Tighten the belt until the tension is close to the one in a car. The tension is estimated subjectively. Press Tighten belt one more time to stop the belt tightening.
5. Screw the adapter on the positive terminal of the alternator.
6. Connect the power cable B- to the unit body, then connect the power cable Ð’+ to the adapter at the negative terminal of alternator.

6.2. Alternator testing
1. Press Alternator & starter tester, then press button 12V/24V to choose the required voltage referring to the specifications of the diagnosed alternator.
WARNING! With the pressing of the button Alternator & starter tester you start the mode of diagnostics of Lamp alternator types.
2. Connect the bench diagnostic outputs (ref. 3, fig. 3 @D_25_IMG_003_PHOTO_bench-control-panel_fig3) with the alternator connector terminals.
3. Choose the relevant alternator type on the control panel.
3.1. If the diagnosed alternator is of COM type, wait until the bench identifies ID and TYPE of alternator.
3.2. If the alternator has a terminal: L, D+, I, IL, 61, the control lamp indicator shall light up.
3.3. If the diagnosed alternator is of COM type, the notification on the mechanical failure MEC will appear near the indicator ERROR.
4. Rotate the knob ROTATION SPEED to the left/right referring to the alternator rotation direction (commonly, alternators rotate clockwise - if you look from pulley side) and set the rotation speed within the limits of 100 - 150 rpm.
WARNING! For the alternators with the freewheel clutches, be more cautious when choosing the rotation direction.
4.1. Visually inspect if the alternator rotates properly (the alternator shall not vibrate). If there are the abnormal noises that may inform on the mechanical failure, stop the diagnostics.
5. Check the rotation speed when the generation starts as follows:
5.1. Set the voltage value 14.5V for 12V alternators and 29V for 24V alternators, rotating the knob REGULATION GC.
5.2. With ROTATION SPEED knob, increase smoothly the speed until the alternator output voltage is equal to nominated voltage. Most of the operative alternators start generation from 700 - 850 drive revolutions. Some alternators of COM type start generation at the speed higher than 1200, besides, there are LRC alternators (Load Response Control) that have the temporary delay at the output voltage variation.
5.3. For Lamp type alternators, the stabilizing voltage value shall be set within 14 - 14.8 V for 12V alternators, and within 28 - 29.8 V for 24V alternators.
5.4. If the alternator is equipped with the control lamp indicator it shall go off.
5.5. If the diagnosed alternator is of COM type, the mechanical error shall disappear.
6. Check the alternator voltage regulator as follows:
6.1. With the knob ROTATION SPEED, set the speed within 1500-2000 rpm.
6.2 (For the Lamp type alternators without voltage control, this paragraph is skipped). With the knob REGULATION GC, set smoothly the alternator output voltage within 13 - 15V. The measured voltage shall vary in proportion to the nominated one.
7. Check the alternator operation under the load as follows:
7.1. Set the speed within 2500-3000 rpm rotating the knob ROTATION SPEED.
7.2. Rotate the knob ELECTRICAL LOAD to smoothly increase the alternator load. To effectively check the alternator condition, the current load rate of 50 - 70 A is enough. At the same time, the output voltage value shall remain constant while the alternating current value (I, AC) in the circuit B+ shall not exceed 10% of the nominated load value (e.g., at the load of 50A, the value I, AC shall not exceed 5A).
8. Once the alternator diagnostics is finished, shed the alternator load and stop the drive briefly pressing ELECTRICAL LOAD and ROTATION SPEED. Then press the button Alternator & starter tester and dismount the alternator from the bench.

6.3. Diagnostics of alternator that doesn't have the integral voltage regulator

7. TEST BENCH MAINTENANCE
The bench is designed for a long operation life. However, to prolong the period of the trouble-free operation of the bench, it should be inspected on a regular basis, and the preventive maintenance described below should be carried out with the recommended intervals. The inspection and the preventive maintenance shall be carried out by the qualified specialists.
The preventive maintenance that shall be carried out daily is as follows:
â€¢ Motor operation inspection (uncommon noises, vibration etc.).
â€¢ Inspection of bench operation environment (temperature, humidity etc.).
â€¢ Control of the voltage specification limits.

Once a month check the technical condition of battery, the level of electrolyte and battery charge.
The battery charge level shall be so high that the battery voltage (without load) was not lower than 12.5V (at the temperature 25 Â°Ð¡ it corresponds to 75% charge level). If the battery has to be charged, mount the operative 12V alternator on the bench and start the mode of its diagnostics without the load for about 10-15 minutes.

7.1. Cleaning and care
Use soft tissues or wipe cloths to clean the surface of the device with neutral detergents. Clean the display with a special fiber cloth and a cleaning spray for touch screens. To prevent corrosion, failure, or damage to the test bench, do not use any abrasives or solvents.
