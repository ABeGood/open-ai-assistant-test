In case of failures in the operation of the bench, stop further operation and contact the manufacturer or sales representative.
WARNING! The manufacturer is not responsible for any damage or injury to human health resulting from non-compliance with the requirements of this user manual.

5.1. Safety guidelines

Only specially trained personnel who are authorized to operate benches of specific types and have undergone instruction on safe work methods are permitted to work on the bench.
The bench must be turned off during cleaning or maintenance.
The workspace must always be kept clean, well-lit, and have sufficient free space.
To ensure electrical and fire safety, it is STRICTLY PROHIBITED to:

Connect the bench to an electrical network that has a faulty overload protection system or lacks such protection.
Use a power socket without a grounding contact to connect the bench.
Use extension cords to connect the bench to the power supply. If the socket is far from the bench's installation location, the electrical network must be modified, and a socket must be installed.
Operate the bench in a faulty condition.

It is prohibited to leave units with the drive activated on the bench unattended.
When installing a unit on the bench, exercise extra caution to prevent hand injuries.
The unit under diagnosis must be securely fastened (properly fixed).

5.2. Preparing the bench for operation
The bench is delivered packaged. Unpack the bench, remove any packaging materials, and peel off the protective film from the display (if present). After unpacking, ensure that the bench is intact and free from any damage. If any damage is detected, do not power on the bench; instead, contact the manufacturer or sales representative.
The bench should be installed on a flat floor. If the surface is uneven, the bench legs can be adjusted for height to compensate. Ensure a minimum clearance of 0.5 meters on the right side of the bench to allow proper air circulation.
Before operating the bench, the following connections must be made:

Battery (12V): Place the 12V batteries in the battery compartment of the bench. Follow the markings on the power cables when connecting the batteries. If only one battery is connected, it must be connected to Battery 1, and Battery 2 must be disconnected by removing the fuse. In this case, the 24V diagnostic mode will not be available.
Electrical network (400V): Use the socket included with the bench for connection. Follow the internal markings (L1, L2, L3, N, PE) when connecting the socket to the power supply network.

ALTERNATOR TESTING
For all types of alternators, the following common diagnostic stages are provided:
Installation of the alternator on the bench and its fixation.
Installation of the belt on the pulley and its tensioning.
Connection of power wires to the alternator. For convenient connection, an adapter should be screwed onto the positive terminal of the alternator for the connection of the power terminal B+.
Connect the diagnostic cable to the terminals in the alternator socket.
Select the appropriate parameters for the alternator test.
Diagnosis of the alternator.
Dismounting the unit from the bench.

6.1. Installing and removing the alternator

Extend the chain to a sufficient length to wrap around the alternator.
Place the alternator on the working platform, ensuring that the pulley is positioned directly above the belt.
Position the chain over the alternator and secure its end to the bench. Then, tighten the chain.
CAUTION! Be careful not to injure your fingers.
Loosen the belt enough to allow it to fit over the alternator pulley. Then, tighten the belt.
ATTENTION! Position the chain on the alternator such that after the belt is tightened, the alternator remains in a horizontal position. Misalignment of the alternator may cause the belt to slip on the pulley, leading to rapid wear.
Screw the adapter onto the "B+" terminal.
Connect the black power cable ("B-") to the alternator's housing and the red power cable ("B+") to the adapter.
For the most accurate measurement results, connect the diagnostic connectors "B+" and "B-" to the alternator's positive output and housing, respectively.
After diagnostics, remove the alternator in reverse order.
WARNING!  Alternator removal is only permitted after the drive has fully stopped and the test mode has been exited.

6.2. Connecting the bench diagnostic connectors to the alternator
To evaluate the performance of the alternator, the bench diagnostic connectors must be properly connected to the alternator's terminals. This can be done in two ways:

Using the wire set included with the bench, which connects to the diagnostic connectors (see item 1 in Fig. 3 @D_16_IMG_003_PHOTO_control-panel_fig3).
Using special cables, which are purchased separately.
Connecting the alternator using the wire set included with the bench:
Locate the original alternator part number, typically found on the housing or rear cover, and use it to search for information about the terminal designations in the alternator's connector online.
Using this information, connect the alternator to the bench following the examples provided below.

Example 1: Connecting a Bosch alternator (part number 0986049191, Fig. 9 @D_16_IMG_009_PHOTO_Bosch-0986049191-alternator_example1_fig9 @D_16_IMG_010_PHOTO_Bosch-0986049191-terminals_example1_fig9).

6.3. Manual mode alternator diagnostics

After securing and connecting the alternator, navigate to the "Alternator" menu.
In the opened window, select the following:

The nominal voltage of the alternator being diagnosed.
The alternator type.
The maximum test current.
The pulley diameter.
WARNING! Selecting a maximum test current exceeding the alternator's specifications can result in alternator failure.

Press the "Test" button to initiate the diagnostic process.
WARNING!  It is recommended to switch to diagnostic mode by pressing the "Test" button only after connecting the bench's diagnostic connectors to the alternator's terminals.
Before starting the bench drive, ensure the following:
4.1. For COM or I-STARS alternators, wait for the bench to detect the alternator's ID and TYPE.
4.2. For alternators equipped with regulator terminals such as "A", "IG", "R", or "15", activate the "K15" toggle switch by sliding it to the left.
4.3. The leakage current of the deactivated alternator, shown as the "Leak" parameter, must not exceed 1 mA.
Evaluate the alternator's voltage regulator based on the following criteria:
5.1. If the alternator type is COM or I-STARS, the bench should detect the alternator's ID, COM speed, and TYPE. Additionally, the Errors indicator should display a mechanical fault message ("MEC").
5.2. If the alternator includes a warning lamp, its indicator should light up.
Adjust the "SPEED" knob to set the rotational speed of the alternator between 100 to 150 RPM, depending on the alternator's rotational direction. Typically, alternators rotate clockwise when viewed from the pulley side.
WARNING! If the alternator has a freewheel pulley, carefully ensure the correct rotation direction.
6.1. Visually assess the alternator's rotation. If noise or vibration indicating mechanical failure occurs, stop the diagnostic process.
Verify the alternator's startup speed by performing the following:
7.1. Gradually increase the drive speed until the output voltage matches the preset value. Most functional alternators begin generating power at 700–850 RPM. Some COM-type alternators start generating at over 1200 RPM. Additionally, alternators with LRC (Load Response Control) may have a temporary delay in output voltage changes.
7.2. For Lamp-type alternators, the stabilization voltage should be between 14–14.8 V for 12 V alternators and 28–29.8 V for 24 V alternators.
7.3. For C JAPAN and I-Eloop alternators, the stabilization voltage should be between 14–14.5 V.
7.4. If the alternator includes a warning lamp indicator, it should turn off.
7.5. For COM or I-STARS alternators, the mechanical fault should clear from the Errors display.
Evaluate voltage regulator performance:
8.1. Set the drive speed within the range of 1500–2000 RPM.
8.2. For alternators with an S terminal (AS, BVS) in the connector, check its functionality. To do this, move the toggle switch in the "Sense" parameter line to the left—the output voltage should increase. Return the toggle switch to its original position—the output voltage should return to its previous value.
8.3. Gradually adjust the alternator's output voltage using the "VOLTAGE" knob within the range of 13 to 15 V. The measured voltage should change proportionally to the setting. For Lamp-type alternators (without output voltage control), this step is not required.
8.4. For C JAPAN and I-ELOOP alternators:

Set the stabilization voltage to the Low mode. The measured stabilization voltage should be within 12 to 12.7 V.
Switch the stabilization voltage to the Hi mode. The measured stabilization voltage should be within 14 to 14.5 V.

Evaluate alternator performance under load:
9.1. Set the drive to maximum speed.
9.2. Set the generation voltage to 13.8 V. For C JAPAN and I-ELOOP alternators, enable the Hi mode.
9.3. Gradually increase the alternator load to the maximum using the "LOAD" knob. During this process:

The output voltage should remain stable.
The AC current value on the B+ circuit (I, AC) must not exceed 10% of the set load value (e.g., at a load of 50A, I, AC should not exceed 5A).
The current waveform on the oscilloscope should not show significant peaks, and the values should fluctuate within consistent limits.

Test IStars-Type alternators in starter mode:
10.1. Stop the alternator drive.
10.2. Press the "Starter" button to activate the starter mode. The alternator should reach the engine idle speed.
10.3. Press the "Starter" button again to stop the alternator.
After completing the diagnostics:

Reset the load on the alternator and stop the drive by briefly pressing the "LOAD" and "SPEED" controls.
Exit the diagnostic mode.
Once the diagnostics are complete, the alternator can be removed from the bench.
Failure to comply with any of the requirements in points 5 – 10.3 indicates a fault in the alternator.

STARTER DIAGNOSTICS
When switching to starter diagnostic mode, the following information is displayed on the screen (Fig. 14 @D_16_IMG_019_PHOTO_starter-testing-mode-menu_fig14):

Exit the diagnostic mode. After this, the starter can be removed from the bench.

VOLTAGE REGULATOR DIAGNOSTICS
For all types of voltage regulators, the following general diagnostic steps are provided:

Connecting the regulator to the test bench;
Selecting the type and nominal voltage of the diagnosed regulator;
Evaluating the operability of the control lamp. At speeds close to zero, the red battery discharge indicator should light up. When the speed exceeds 800 – 1200 rpm, the indicator should go out;
The operability of the "S" terminal is evaluated;
The ability of the regulator to adjust to the specified stabilization voltage is assessed.
WARNING! The test bench checks voltage regulators without load, so some Bosch TM regulators cannot be tested by the bench.

8.1. Voltage regulator connection
To assess the functionality of a voltage regulator proper connection of the voltage regulator to the bench's diagnostic terminals is required.
Use the original part number of the regulator to search online for terminal designations. Then connect the wires to the diagnostic terminals of the bench and the voltage regulator, following the examples provided below.
WARNING! When connecting clips to the terminals, exercise extreme caution to prevent damage to the regulator. Only use clips with fully enclosed insulation.
Figure 16 illustrates the example of the connection layout for the regulator ARE1054. @D_16_IMG_021_PHOTO_regulator-ARE1054-connection-layout_fig16
Figure 16. Regulator ARE1054 @D_16_IMG_021_PHOTO_regulator-ARE1054-connection-layout_fig16
Use the information in the Appendix 1 to determine the regulator type referring to the connector terminals (fig. 16 @D_16_IMG_021_PHOTO_regulator-ARE1054-connection-layout_fig16). The terminal L(RVC) points to RVC regulator type. Then, referring to the Appendix 1, determine what diagnostics terminals of the bench shall be connected with the regulator. The layout of the connection of the regulator ARE1054 to the bench is provided in the table 6.

Referring to the connector terminals and the information in the Appendix 1, determine the regulator type. In this case, the terminals IG, S и FR(M) don't determine the regulator type. The terminal L points to Lamp regulator type. Then, referring to the Appendix 1, determine what diagnostics terminals of the bench shall be connected with the regulator. The layout of the connection of the regulator ARE6076 to the bench is provided in the table 7.

There's a specific thing about the connection of ARE6076 regulator. The figure 17 illustrates only the terminal F which we connect with the bench output FLD1. The bench output FLD2 shall be connected to the terminal B+ since one of the relay brushes is permanently connected to В+ while the excitation winding coil is being controlled through the brush connected to the alternator 'negative' (A-circuit breaking type).
Figure 18 illustrates the example of connection layout of ARE6149P regulator. @D_16_IMG_023_PHOTO_regulator-ARE6149P-connection-layout_fig18

Referring to the voltage regulator connector terminals and the Appendix 1, identify the regulator type. Here we have just one LIN terminal that points to COM regulator.
Now, referring to the Appendix 1, determine what diagnostics terminals of the bench shall be connected with the regulator. The layout of the connection of the regulator ARE6149P to the bench is provided in the table 8.

There's a specific thing about the connection of ARE6149P regulator. The figure 18 illustrates only the terminal F which we connect with the bench output FLD1. The bench output FLD2 shall be connected to the terminal B- since one of the relay brushes is permanently connected to В- while the excitation winding coil is being controlled through the brush connected to the alternator 'positive' (B-circuit breaking type).

8.2. Diagnostics

Connect the regulator to the bench using the procedure (examples) described in section 8.1.
In the regulator type selection menu, select the nominal voltage of the regulator being diagnosed (12 V or 24 V) and the appropriate regulator type. Press the "Test" button to enter the diagnostic menu.
If the regulator has terminal A, IG, or 15, activate the toggle switch "K15".
3.1. For COM-type regulators, wait for the data to be read. Once values appear in the fields "ID", "Version LIN", and "Type", proceed with further diagnostics.
Assess the operation of the warning lamp:
4.1. For a functioning regulator, at 0 RPM, the red battery indicator should illuminate. As the RPM increases beyond 800–1200 RPM, the warning lamp indicator should turn off.
4.1. For COM-type regulators, at 0 RPM, the parameter field "ERRORS" should display "M". When the RPM exceeds 800–1200, the "M" value should disappear.
Increase the RPM to the maximum and evaluate the regulator's ability to adjust to the specified stabilization voltage.
5.1. Adjust the stabilization voltage from minimum to maximum. The measured stabilization voltage should change proportionally to the set value.
5.2. For LAMP-type regulators, voltage regulation is not supported. The stabilization voltage should be within 14–14.8 V for 12 V regulators and 28–29.8 V for 24 V regulators.
5.3. For C JAPAN-type regulators:

Set the stabilization voltage to "Low" mode. The measured stabilization voltage should equal the battery voltage.
Then, set the stabilization voltage to "Hi" mode. The measured stabilization voltage should be within 14–14.7 V.

If the regulator has terminal S (or AS, BVS), test its functionality:

Move the toggle switch in the "Sense" parameter field to the left. The output voltage should increase.
Return the toggle switch to its original position. The output voltage should return to its previous value.

Failure to meet any of the requirements in steps 3.1–6 indicates a fault in the regulator. For COM-type regulators, if the "ERRORS" field displays "E" or "T", this also indicates a fault.
Exit the diagnostic mode by pressing the "BACK" button. Disconnect the wires from the regulator.
TEST BENCH MAINTENANCE
The bench is designed for a long operation life and doesn't have any special maintenance requirements. At the same time, to ensure the maximum operation life, the regular monitoring of bench technical condition should be made as follows:
- motor operation inspection (uncommon noises, vibration etc.);
- alternator drive belts condition (visual inspection);
- power wires condition (visual inspection);
- inspection of bench operation environment (temperature, humidity etc.).

9.1. Test bench firmware update
The bench supports updating:

Extract all the contents of the downloaded archive to the root directory of the USB flash drive.
WARNING! The USB flash drive must contain only the files from the archive.
Insert the USB flash drive into the USB port of the bench.
Once the USB flash drive icon appears on the main screen, go to the bench settings menu and press the corresponding update button: "Update firmware" or "Update database".
Wait for the installation to complete.
WARNING! Do not interrupt the update process by turning off the bench or removing the USB flash drive.
After the installation is complete, the bench will automatically restart.
Remove the USB flash drive. The bench is now ready for use.

9.2. Cleaning and care
Use soft tissues or wipe cloths to clean the surface of the device with neutral detergents. Clean the display with a special fiber cloth and a cleaning spray for touch screens. To prevent corrosion, failure, or damage to the test bench, do not use any abrasives or solvents.
