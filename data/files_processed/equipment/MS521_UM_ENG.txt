MS521 MECHANISM FOR DIAGNOSTICS OF POWER STEERING RACKS UNDER LOAD @D_26_IMG_000_PHOTO_ms521-mechanism_general-view

USER MANUAL

INTRODUCTION
Thank you for choosing the product of MSG Equipment.
The present user manual consists of the information on the application, equipment set, technical specifications, as well as the rules for safe operation of the MS521 mechanism.
Before using the MS521 mechanism (hereinafter referred to as "the mechanism"), please carefully review this user manual.
Due to the permanent improvements of the mechanism, the design and supply slip are subject to modifications that are not included to the present user manual. Therefore, no claims can be made regarding the data and illustrations in this User Manual.

1. APPLICATION
The MS521 mechanism is designed to work in conjunction with the MS502M test bench and provides resistance to the movement of the steering rack rod, simulating the load from turning the vehicle's wheels. This allows for the detection of faults in the hydraulic power steering system that manifest only under resistance to the rod's movement: the presence of leaks in the distributor, the condition of the hydraulic cylinder's central seal, and wear of the cylinder body in the central part.

2. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Dimensions (L×W×H), mm	1400×350×300
Weight, kg	63.5
Power source	compressed air
Working pressure of compressed air, bar	from 6 to 10
Maximum generated load, kg	250

The equipment complete set includes:
Item name	Number of pcs
MS521 Mechanism	1
Step adapter for rack installation	2
MS00110 - set of steering rack rod limiters	1
User Manual (card with QR code)	1

4. MECHANISM DESCRIPTION
The mechanism consists of the following main elements (see Fig. 1 @D_26_IMG_001_DIAGRAM_mechanism-main-elements_fig1):
1 - Movable support of the rack rod;
2 - Rack body stop;
3 - Movable rack body stop;
4 - Adjustment handle for the position of the movable rack body stop, which is used to secure the steering rack body in the mechanism;
5 - Load direction switch, which has three positions: neutral, load left, load right;
6 - Pressure gauge;
7 - Pressure regulator;
8 - Fitting for connecting the compressed air source.

5. APPROPRIATE USE

1. Use the mechanism only for its intended purpose (see section 1).
2. The mechanism is designed for indoor use at a temperature of +10 to +40°C and a relative humidity of no more than 75%, without moisture condensation.
3. To avoid damage or failure of the mechanism, modifications are not allowed. The mechanism must not be altered by anyone other than the official manufacturer.
4. In case of malfunctions in the mechanism's operation, discontinue its use and contact the manufacturer's technical support service or a sales representative.
WARNING! The manufacturer is not responsible for any damage or injury to human health resulting from non-compliance with the requirements of this user manual.

5.1. Safety guidelines
1. Only specially trained personnel who have been authorized to work with certain types of test benches and have undergone instruction on safe working practices are allowed to work on the MS502M bench using the MS521 mechanism.
2. The workplace must be kept clean and well lit. Clutter and unlit areas of the workplace can lead to accidents.
3. When installing the steering rack on the mechanism, exercise caution to prevent finger injuries.

5.2. Preparing the mechanism for operation
The mechanism is delivered packaged. Remove the mechanism from its packaging materials. After unpacking, ensure that the mechanism is intact and has no damage. If any damage is found, contact the manufacturer or sales representative.
The mechanism is installed and secured on the MS502M bench table in place of the MS522 pneumatic clamps.

6. OPERATION OF THE MECHANISM DURING STEERING RACK DIAGNOSTICS
The procedure for working with the load mechanism during the diagnostics of a steering rack is as follows:
1. Mount the step adapters or rod limiters from the MS00110 set onto the ends of the rack rod.

WARNING! Be cautious to avoid injuring your fingers.

4. Connect the compressed air source to the fitting (see position 8 in Fig. 1 @D_26_IMG_001_DIAGRAM_mechanism-main-elements_fig1).

6. Connect the high and low-pressure hoses of the test bench to the rack and perform diagnostics as described in the MS502M test bench User Manual.

6.1. During the steering rack diagnostics, use switch 5 in Fig. 1 @D_26_IMG_001_DIAGRAM_mechanism-main-elements_fig1 to create resistance to the movement of the rack rod in the corresponding direction.

6.2. The criteria for evaluating the condition of the steering rack are provided in the MS502M test bench User Manual.

7. Upon completion of the diagnostics, disconnect the compressed air source from the mechanism and remove the rack.

7. MECHANISM MAINTENANCE
The mechanism is designed for long-term use and does not require special maintenance.

7.1. Cleaning and care
To clean the surface of the mechanism, use soft wipes or cloths with neutral cleaning agents. To avoid corrosion, malfunction, or damage to the mechanism, do not use abrasives or solvents.

8. DISPOSAL
Equipment deemed unfit for use must be disposed of.
The equipment does not contain any chemical, biological, or radioactive elements that could harm human health or the environment when proper storage and usage rules are followed.
