Title: Equipment for Diagnostics and Repair of Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS) Systems | MSG Equipment
Description: Professional equipment for testing steering racks and hydraulic power steering pumps on vehicles and in dismounted condition. Stands and testers for HPS diagnostics.

Equipment for Diagnostics and Repair of Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS) Systems
Hydraulic power steering (HPS) systems provide comfortable vehicle control and enhance road safety. The need for regular diagnostics and timely maintenance of hydraulic power steering systems is due to their direct impact on vehicle handling. MSG Equipment develops and manufactures professional equipment for diagnostics and repair of HPS system components, allowing detection and elimination of malfunctions at early stages.

Types of Equipment for Hydraulic Power Steering Diagnostics and Repair
The line of diagnostic and repair equipment for hydraulic power steering systems includes various technical solutions:
• Stands for testing steering racks with hydraulic power steering
• Testers for HPS system diagnostics on vehicles without dismounting units
• Equipment for flushing hydraulic steering systems
• Stands for diagnostics of hydraulic power steering pumps
• Mechanisms for testing steering racks under load
• Machines for restoring steering rack rods
• Auxiliary equipment for HPS component repair

Functional Capabilities of HPS Diagnostics and Repair Equipment
Stands for diagnosing steering racks with hydraulic power steering provide simulation of unit operation on the vehicle. This allows identification of malfunctions such as unit leakage, seal wear, housing damage and Teflon ring defects. The equipment creates working pressure up to 140 bar and provides working fluid flow up to 5.9 l/min, corresponding to real operating conditions of the hydraulic power steering system.
Testers for HPS system diagnostics allow checking the functionality of hydraulic system elements without dismounting them from the vehicle. They connect to the high-pressure line and measure pressure and working fluid flow in various operating modes. Portable testers enable determination of pump and steering rack condition, detection of distributor wear and ring wear in the power cylinder housing.
Equipment for flushing hydraulic steering systems provides complete system cleaning from old fluid that has lost its operational properties and contains mechanical impurities. Such stands also allow testing the functionality of both vehicle-mounted and dismounted HPS system components.
Machines for restoring steering rack rods provide uniform rod surface polishing, returning functionality to parts that can be difficult to replace. Rod restoration significantly reduces repair costs compared to replacing the entire steering rack, making the service economically attractive for auto service customers.

Technical Capabilities of HPS Diagnostics and Repair Equipment
Professional diagnostic equipment for hydraulic power steering systems has a wide range of technical capabilities:
• Diagnostics of all types of hydraulic steering racks and HPS pumps
• Use of special working fluid ATF DEXRON II
• Working fluid tank capacity from 18 to 22 liters
• Working fluid pressure measurement range from 0 to 250 bar
• System fluid flow control from 0 to 19 l/min
• Maximum working fluid pressure adjustment in steering rack
• Working fluid temperature measurement from 0 to 100°C
• Load simulation from steering rack when testing HPS pump
• Pump pulley rotation speed adjustment from 0 to 1500 rpm
• Smooth drive rotation speed adjustment
• Drive rotation direction selection when testing pumps
• Compact design of individual models for mobile use

Equipment for Steering Rack Diagnostics Under Load
Equipment for diagnosing steering racks under load is of particular value, providing resistance to rack rod movement, simulating load from vehicle wheel turning. Such mechanisms allow identification of malfunctions that manifest only under resistance: distributor leakage, central hydraulic cylinder seal condition, housing wear in the middle part of the hydraulic cylinder.
Mechanisms operating from compressed air pneumatic lines provide maximum rod load up to 250 kg at working air pressure from 2 to 10 bar. Using such equipment in combination with steering rack diagnostic stands significantly increases result reliability and helps identify hidden defects.

Auxiliary Equipment for HPS Repair
Specialized tools and fixtures are used to ensure quality repair of hydraulic power steering components. Pneumatic vises provide quick fixation of cylindrical objects with diameters from 35 to 85 mm with clamping force up to 1400 Newtons, necessary for HPS steering rack disassembly and assembly. Such vises are controlled using a pneumatic distributor, improving convenience and productivity of repair work.
Such auxiliary equipment is an integral part of the repair process, providing reliable unit fixation during service, significantly improving work quality and speed while reducing the risk of damage to expensive components.

Applications of HPS Diagnostic Equipment
Specialized equipment for hydraulic power steering diagnostics and repair is in demand in various automotive service sectors:
• Multi-profile auto services servicing vehicles with hydraulic power steering
• Specialized steering system repair shops
• Dealer centers performing warranty service
• Manufacturers and rebuilders of steering racks and HPS pumps
• Service stations with steering system repair departments

Recommendations for HPS Equipment Selection and Purchase
When selecting diagnostic equipment for hydraulic power steering work, it is necessary to consider auto service specifics, volume and nature of performed work. For basic HPS system diagnostics, portable testers are suitable, allowing determination of general hydraulic system condition without unit dismounting.
For a complete repair department, an optimal solution would be a comprehensive equipment set including stands for steering rack and pump diagnostics, mechanisms for load testing and hydraulic system flushing equipment. This will provide a complete service cycle for HPS system components.
