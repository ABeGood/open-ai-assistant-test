Menu <<Sensor settings>> (Fig.15 @D_34_IMG_015_PHOTO_sensor-settings-screen_fig15) includes the following:
1 - Sensors calibration. Any change of these settings is prohibited as it may cause the Test Bench breakdown. These settings are used by service specialists of the stand manufacturer during repair work.
2 - Setting vacuum for refrigerant pumping after the compressor diagnostics has been completed. The recommended value is -0.6 Bar. The higher value will raise up the risk of the air ingress into the system and subsequent deterioration of the Test Bench performance. The lower value is permitted. It will cut the time necessary for the refrigerant evacuation albeit increase its loss.
3 - Setting vacuum for air pumping before launching the compressor diagnostics. The recommended value is -0.9 Bar. The higher value is not recommended as the Test Bench may not reach it. The lower value is permitted. It will cut the time of vacuuming, but will increase the amount of air in the system and therefore the frequency of the Test Bench refilling.
4 - Setting additional pumping time after the set vacuum has been achieved. Regardless of the pressure, the Test Bench will be pumping the unit during the pre-set time period to allow evacuation of the refrigerant separated from oil. We do not recommend to set additional pumping time more than 5 minutes - 90% of the refrigerant will be released from the oil within the first minute.
5 - Setting the timer clock for emergency stop. The process will be stopped at the pre-set time regardless of the pre-set vacuum value.

5. APPROPRIATE USE
1. Use the test bench as intended only (read Section 1).
WARNING! The Test Bench operates on refrigerants either R134a or R1234yf. It is strongly recommended not to use other refrigerants. Oil PAG46yf must be used for the systems on R1234yf and R134a.
2. Turning off the bench should be done through the interface of the service program by pressing the "Turn off the bench" button.
3. Use the button <<EMERGENCY STOP>> only if necessary to stop the diagnostic process in an emergency.
4. The accuracy of the compressor test depends on the amount of refrigerant in the test bench.
Observe standard filling rate.
5. The refrigerant leak occurs every time after the replacement of a tested unit. Refrigerant deficiency in the system leads to inaccurate test results and may cause damage to the tested unit.
Evacuate refrigerant from the system at the end of the working day and fill it in before you start.
6. In case compressor sealing gaskets lost their airtightness, air can enter the system during refrigerant pumping. Air in the system may cause diagnostics inaccuracy and damage to the tested unit.
Refill the system after the message "Too much air in the system" appears on the screen.
7. Automatic test mode is intended for the initial assessment of compressor performance and cannot be used for detection of such latent faults as, for example, sporadic sticking of a control valve and some others.
If any malfunction is detected during automatic testing, proceed with a manual test for accurate diagnostics of a unit.
8. During compressor diagnostics, wear particles normally retained by the test bench filters, can penetrate the system. These filters require periodic replacement.   The test bench will signal the necessity for filter replacement.
Do not test compressors with obvious symptoms of malfunction. For example, the oil in a compressor is black and has metal shavings in it.
9. The use of inappropriate computer hardware or firmware will cause cancellation of the warranty (even if the computer facilities or programs were removed or deleted shortly after). Only the MSG Equipment original firmware can be used with this equipment.
10. To prevent the damage and the failure of the bench, do not make any modifications in the bench in your discretion. Any modifications can be effected by the official manufacturer only. Should the bench have defects contact the manufacturer or a dealer.
11. In case of failures in the operation of the bench, stop further operation and contact the manufacturer or sales representative.
WARNING! The manufacturer is not responsible for any damage or injury to human health resulting from non-compliance with the requirements of this manual.

5.1. Safety guidelines
1. The Test Bench should only be used by the persons qualified to operate the test benches of certain types who received a special training in the equipment safety operation.
2. Before the unit dismounting from the test bench, the refrigerant should be evacuated.
3. Before starting any maintenance work on the bench, disconnect it from the electrical network.
4. The workplace should be clean, well-lit and spacious.
5. The use of the faulty or unearthed Test Bench is strictly prohibited.
6. The compressor mounting and/or dismounting should be conducted carefully to prevent its fall.
7. The unit with the running drive may not be left on the test bench unattended.
8. It is strictly forbidden to open the door of the power compartment (n. 2, Fig.1 @D_34_IMG_001_PHOTO_test-bench-major-components_fig1) when the test bench is connected to 400V power supply.
9. Avoid body contact with the refrigerant, it may lead to a frostbite (R134a boiling point is -26degS, R1234yf boiling point is -30degS).
10. Do not inhale refrigerant vapors.
11. It is strongly recommended to use protective gloves and glasses.
12. Any refrigerant is a colorless and odorless gas which is heavier than air. Entering the atmosphere, it can cause asphyxiation or heart rhythm disorders. That is why, the Test Bench should be used in well-ventilated premises only. The available exhaust units in the room must be switched on.
13. Refrigerant R-1234yf is a highly flammable gas. Take extra care when working with this refrigerant.
14. Open flame sources are allowed nowhere near the test bench operating area. Smoking near the Test Bench is prohibited. A regular fire-extinguishing appliance is a must.
15. If the protective caps of the filling fittings cannot be easily unscrewed, there is a risk of injury due to the valves poor tightness.
16. Securely attach connectors to the compressor before connecting high and low-pressure hoses.
17. The compressor under diagnosis must be securely fastened.

5.2. Preparing the test bench for use 
The bench is delivered packed. Release the bench from the packaging materials, remove the protective film from the display (if available). After unpacking, it is necessary to make sure that the bench is intact and does not have any damage. If damage is detected before the bench is activated, contact the manufacturer or the sales representative.
The bench has to be placed on the level floor, with the pivot wheels fixed from rotating (min. two wheels) by the activating of the brake mechanism.
The bench ensures the operation at the temperature from +18degC up to +38degC and relative air humidity from 10% up to 75%.
Considering that the Test Bench components are exposed to heating during operation, the working room should be well-ventilated. To ensure a free circulation of air, it is necessary to provide the airspace of no less than 0.5m behind the back panel of the bench and 0.3m on either side of it. Don't block the air flow behind the test bench.
Before operating the test bench, it is necessary to:
1. Connect a 400V power supply. To do this, it is necessary to upgrade the electrical network and install a socket (included in the delivery set) near the test bench. The socket is marked with L1 L2 L3 N PE, and this marking must be strictly followed when connecting to the power network. Connecting the grounding wire is MANDATORY; otherwise, the manufacturer reserves the right to void the warranty.
1.1. A 40 A circuit breaker must be installed in the test bench power circuit as a protective device. The use of a residual-current device (RCD) in the power circuit of the test bench is PROHIBITED due to design features.
2. Refill the bench with refrigerant.

5.2.1. Refilling of the test bench
The test bench is delivered to a customer charged with refrigerant R134a for 10-15% and with a full charge of oil. To ensure the Test Bench performance, it is necessary to fill the hydraulic system up to the standard level. The required amount of the refrigerant is specified in the chart "Technical characteristics" (Item 2 of the Manual).
WARNING! Refilling of the test bench directly from a container with the refrigerant is strictly prohibited as it can lead to emergency situations.
WARNING! Use specialized equipment for evacuation and purification of the refrigerant R134a and system refilling. Observe the instructions set out in the corresponding User Manual.

Refilling of the hydraulic system with the refrigerant should be performed as follows:
1. Open the door of the service compartment (n.5, Fig.1 @D_34_IMG_001_PHOTO_test-bench-major-components_fig1) with a special key (included in the equipment set).
2. There are two fittings for refilling of the test bench hydraulic system: <<Service LP>> and <<Service HP>> (n.5, Fig.5 @D_34_IMG_005_PHOTO_test-bench-service-compartment_fig5).
3. Connect the filling station lines to the test bench fittings. High-pressure and low-pressure valves (n.1,5, Fig. 3 @D_34_IMG_003_PHOTO_test-bench-control-panel_fig3) located on the control panel (Fig.3 @D_34_IMG_003_PHOTO_test-bench-control-panel_fig3) should be in the closed position (OFF).
4. Pump the refrigerant out of the hydraulic system.
WARNING! It is necessary to control the amount of oil released together with the refrigerant since the same amount of it should be added when refilling.
5. Dehydrate the system to remove the air and moisture residues. To do this, take the filling station off into the air pumping mode. Stop pumping on reaching the pressure of -0.9 Bar.
6. Upon the vacuuming procedure completion, non-condensable impurities must be removed from the filling station in the following manner:
6.1. Disconnect the filling station line from the Test Bench.
6.2. Remove the non-condensed impurities through a special valve (Fig.20 @D_34_IMG_020_PHOTO_filling-station-discharge-valve_fig20) as prescribed in the corresponding Manual for the filling station.
7. Connect the lines of the filling station to the Test Bench. Fill the bench with the necessary amount of the refrigerant and oil.
8. Upon completion, disconnect the filling station lines. Place protective caps on the fittings for better tightness. Close the door of the service compartment with a special key.
Figure 20. Discharge valve of the filling station @D_34_IMG_020_PHOTO_filling-station-discharge-valve_fig20

WARNING! In cases when R1234yf must be used in the test bench, the evacuation of R134a from the system is required. The evacuation time should be extended for 10 min from the rated time. To fill the bench with refrigerant R1234yf, follow the procedure described in User Manual for the filling station and the information specified above.

6. COMPRESSOR DIAGNOSTICS

6.1. Preparation of a compressor for diagnostics
Prepare the compressor for diagnostics as follows:
1. Clean the compressor surface from dirt with a compressed air stream.
2. Unscrew the oil filling cap. Drain the oil into a clear container.
3. Check the oil condition. Wear debris, dark or black color of the oil signal that major moving components of the compressor are significantly worn out. We do not recommend testing such a compressor on the bench as testing of the known-faulty compressor may lead to the contamination of the bench hydraulic system.
4. If the condition of oil is good, add 20-30 ml of the test oil (PAG46yf) into the compressor and screw the cap in.
5. Find proper fittings in the equipment set and fix them on the compressor. Now the compressor is ready for use.

To dismount the compressor, do the following:
 turn off both valves - LP and HP;
 enter the main menu;
 press <<Refrigerant pumping>> to evacuate the refrigerant;
disconnect the hoses;
 release the belt and remove it from the pulley;
 release and remove the chain;
 dismount the compressor from the Test Bench.

6.3. Diagnostics of a compressor in automatic mode
Press "Automatic test" to enter the automatic test mode. Valves 1 and 5 must be in closed position. The window of automatic test mode (Fig.5 @D_34_IMG_005_PHOTO_test-bench-service-compartment_fig5) will appear.
Press "Start" (Fig.5 @D_34_IMG_005_PHOTO_test-bench-service-compartment_fig5, n.5) to launch the automatic testing. The Test Bench will perform the following tests:
- Vacuum tightness test. It may take from one to three operational cycles to complete the test procedure. Every cycle is divided into two stages: air pumping and hold time. During the hold time the compressor tightness will be assessed. Upon completion, the following message will be displayed in the information field: "Ok" - positive test result, "Failed" - negative test result.
- Valves and/or clutches. Upon the test completion, the test result will be displayed in the appropriate line: "Ok" - positive test result, "Failed" - negative test result or some element is missing.
- Compressor productivity. The Test Bench performs diagnostics in two stages at high and low speeds under different heat loads on the evaporator. The test results are displayed in the information field: "Ok" - positive test result, "Failed" - negative test result.
- Noise test. The Test Bench will gradually increase the speed on the compressor pulley. The operator must detect the abnormal noise coming from the compressor. If there is any, press "Ok" @D_34_IMG_039_PHOTO_noise-test-ok-button, if no noise is detected, press "No" @D_34_IMG_040_PHOTO_noise-test-no-button.

The test procedure can be stopped at any time by pressing button "Stop". To restart the procedure, press "Start". The procedure will be launched again from the beginning.
During the procedure, the information messages instructing on the positions of the LP and HP valves will be displayed on the screen. The valves should be turned on/off smoothly to avoid a hydraulic shock.
Figure 31. Information messages displayed during the automatic test @D_34_IMG_041_PHOTO_automatic-test-info-message-1_fig31 @D_34_IMG_042_PHOTO_automatic-test-info-message-2_fig31

Upon completion of all the tests, press "Results". The window with test results will appear. The test results can be saved and/or printed out.
In case one of the test results is negative, the fault should be found and eliminated. After this, the test procedure must be run again.

6.4. Post-maintenance run of a compressor
When the compressor has been repaired and some of its moving parts have been replaced, its post-maintenance run is necessary. Otherwise, the grit resulted from the components wear will inevitably damage the system.
A post-maintenance run of the compressor includes the following steps:
1. Add 20-30g of diagnostic oil (PAG46yf) into the compressor.
2. Fix the compressor on the mounting face of the bench.
3. Select <<Manual mode>>. Make the test bench settings as shown in Fig.32 @D_34_IMG_043_PHOTO_post-maintenance-run-settings_fig32. Set the level of the PWM signal on the electromagnetic valve as 100%.
Figure 32. Test Bench settings for post-maintenance run of a compressor @D_34_IMG_043_PHOTO_post-maintenance-run-settings_fig32

4. Start the procedure by pressing "Valve" and/or "Clutch".
5. During the procedure the temperature must not exceed 60degC. If the temperature is higher, the process must be stopped to allow the unit to cool off.
6. After 10-15 minutes of compressor operation, press "Valve" and/or "Clutch", and then "Stop" to stop the procedure.
7. Pump the refrigerant out and dismount the compressor from the bench.
8. Drain the compressor oil. Assess its condition. If there is grit in the oil, repeat steps 1-7 to continue the compressor running. If the oil doesn't change and there are no signs of wear, the procedure can be finished.
9. If, after the 4th cycle of the procedure, the oil drained from the compressor still has the signs of wear, the further running of the compressor is useless and it must be considered faulty.

6.5. Compressor pre-sale check
A pre-sale check of a compressor can be performed when it is necessary to assess its technical condition and quality.
Run the procedure as follows:
1. Drain the factory oil from the compressor to a clean container.
2. Add 20-30g of diagnostic oil (PAG46yf) to the compressor.
3. Fix the compressor on the test bench as shown in Item 2.3 of the Manual.
4. Select and press <<Automatic test>>.
5. Read Item 2.4 to learn how to perform the procedure in automatic mode
6. Take note of the pressure values in HP and LP lines of the compressor.
7. Upon completion, pump the refrigerant out and dismount the compressor from the bench.
8. Drain the diagnostic oil.
9. Fill the compressor with the factory oil.

7. TEST BENCH MAINTENANCE
To ensure a longtime unfailing performance of a compressor and its objective health assessment, the Test Bench runs self-diagnostic checks and evaluates the condition of its main components on a regular basis. During its operation the following messages can be displayed:
* <<HP pressure is too low!>> (Fig.33 @D_34_IMG_044_PHOTO_hp-pressure-too-low-message_fig33). This message appears when the bench operates in auto test mode and the operator didn't turn the valve off prior to launching "Productivity Test" or "Noise Test".
Figure 33. Message <<PH pressure is too low!>> @D_34_IMG_044_PHOTO_hp-pressure-too-low-message_fig33

* <<HP pressure is too high!>> (Fig.34 @D_34_IMG_045_PHOTO_hp-pressure-too-high-message_fig34). Turn the valves off, enter the main menu and pump the refrigerant out.
Figure 34. Message <<HP pressure is too high!>> @D_34_IMG_045_PHOTO_hp-pressure-too-high-message_fig34

* <<Too much air in the system!>> (Fig.35 @D_34_IMG_046_PHOTO_too-much-air-message_fig35). This message will appear in the following cases:
- incorrect filling of the Test Bench: too much or too little refrigerant in the system;
- ingress of air into the system when leaky compressors are diagnosed;
- high room temperature and incorrect HP fan settings.
Figure 35. Message <<Too much air in the system!>> @D_34_IMG_046_PHOTO_too-much-air-message_fig35

When message <<Too much air in the system!>> is displayed, the following measures must be taken:
1) Refill the test bench with the refrigerant.
2) Make sure the Test Bench position and installation meet the requirements stated in Item 5.2.1.
3) If this message appeared during the Test Bench operation in manual mode, do the following:
- select the higher HP pressure value and test again;
- reduce the speed of the evaporator fan (LP fan).

7.1. Condensate draining
Drain the condensate from the tank as follows: 
1. Disconnect the bench from the power supply.
2. Open the door of the service compartment (n.5 Fig.1 @D_34_IMG_001_PHOTO_test-bench-major-components_fig1) with a special key (included in the equipment set).
3. Unscrew the tank cap (n.3, Fig.36 @D_34_IMG_047_PHOTO_condensate-tank-removal_fig36).
4. Disconnect the condensate level sensor (n.2 Fig.36 @D_34_IMG_047_PHOTO_condensate-tank-removal_fig36).
5. Remove the tank from the test bench by pushing it upward.
6. Empty the tank.
7. Reinstall the tank, reconnect the sensor, put the tank cap on and screw it up.

7.2. Replacement of filters in the hydraulic system of the Test Bench
Observe the actual diagram and Chart 1 for replacement of the filters:
* each message <<Replace filter>> should be followed by replacement of the right filter element MS0101 (Fig.37 @D_34_IMG_048_PHOTO_filter-cover-rotation-direction_fig37);
* every other replacement of the right filter element MS0101 should be followed by replacement of the left filter element MS0101; 
* every forth replacement of the left filter element MS0101 should be followed by replacement of both filter elements MS0102 (Fig.41 @D_34_IMG_052_PHOTO_ms0102-filter-cover-rotation_fig41);

Figure 37. Direction of filter cover rotation during filter replacement MS0101 @D_34_IMG_048_PHOTO_filter-cover-rotation-direction_fig37

WARNING! Since the compression oil is hygroscopic and absorbs moisture from the air, filter elements MS0101 and MS0102 should be reinstalled as quickly as possible.
The procedure of filter MS0101 (n.4, Fig.5 @D_34_IMG_005_PHOTO_test-bench-service-compartment_fig5) replacement is as follows:
1. Put both valves (HP and LP) in "OFF" position and disconnect the bench from the power supply.
2. Open the service compartment door (n.5, Fig.1 @D_34_IMG_001_PHOTO_test-bench-major-components_fig1) with a special key (included in the equipment set).
3. Pump the refrigerant out using a special service station for air conditioners.
4. Level the inside pressure of the Test Bench with the atmospheric pressure by pressing the valve of the filling port. Even a slight pressure difference will make it much more difficult to unscrew the filter cup.
5. Turn the filter cover (n.1, Fig.38 @D_34_IMG_049_PHOTO_refrigerant-filter-structure_fig38) counter-clockwise (Fig.37 @D_34_IMG_048_PHOTO_filter-cover-rotation-direction_fig37) with either a hook wrench or a socket wrench until the filter bowl is free.
6. Check the condition of O-rings (n.3, Fig.38 @D_34_IMG_049_PHOTO_refrigerant-filter-structure_fig38) and replace if necessary.
7. Replace the filter element MS0101 (n.2 Fig. 38 @D_34_IMG_049_PHOTO_refrigerant-filter-structure_fig38).
8. Reinstall the filter cover and screw it clockwise until tight (see Fig.37 @D_34_IMG_048_PHOTO_filter-cover-rotation-direction_fig37).
9. Close the door of the test bench service compartment (n.5 Fig.1 @D_34_IMG_001_PHOTO_test-bench-major-components_fig1).
10. Refill the Test bench with the refrigerant (Item 5.2.2).
