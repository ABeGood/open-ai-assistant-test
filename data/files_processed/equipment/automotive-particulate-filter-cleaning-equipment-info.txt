Title: Equipment for Cleaning and Restoration of Particulate Filters | MSG Equipment
Description: Professional stand for diagnostics and cleaning of particulate filters. Effective cleaning of particulate filters without using chemicals.

Equipment for Cleaning Automotive Particulate Filters
Since 2001, all diesel vehicles have been equipped with particulate filters (DPF/FAP) that reduce harmful emissions into the atmosphere. In case of critical clogging of the particulate filter, its functionality can only be restored through cleaning. MSG Equipment has developed professional equipment for particulate filter service, allowing auto services to offer an alternative to expensive replacement.

Operating Principle of Particulate Filter Cleaning Equipment
The particulate filter cleaning stand represents a comprehensive solution for cleaning DPF, FAP and GPF filters of passenger cars and trucks. Unlike chemical cleaning methods, this equipment uses unique hydrodynamic cleaning technology with flow direction reversal, ensuring effective removal of soot and ash from filtering elements.
A key advantage of the technology is impact on contaminants with compressed air shock pulses that enhance the effect of soot separation from filter walls. This method achieves quality cleaning without using aggressive chemicals, extending filter service life and reducing harmful environmental impact.

Functional Capabilities of Particulate Filter Diagnostics and Cleaning Equipment
The particulate filter service stand performs a complete cycle of operations for restoring filtering element functionality:
1. Initial filter testing to determine contamination level
2. Automated cleaning with reverse fluid supply
3. Filter drying with heated air flow
4. Repeat testing to evaluate cleaning effectiveness

The equipment's modular design allows simultaneous cleaning of one filter and drying of another, practically doubling productivity compared to sequential operation systems. All processes are controlled through an intuitive touch interface, minimizing the need for special personnel training.
