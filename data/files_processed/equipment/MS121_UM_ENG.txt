3 – Control buttons:
The "Up" button @D_5_IMG_002_PHOTO_up-button-control_button – is intended to increase the performance of the automobile air conditioner compressor's electromagnetic valve. A short press increases the performance by 5%, and holding it increases the performance continuously up to a maximum value of 95%. In clutch test mode – not used.
The "Down" button @D_5_IMG_003_PHOTO_down-button-control_button – is intended to decrease the performance of the automobile air conditioner compressor's electromagnetic valve. A short press decreases the performance by 5%, and holding it decreases the performance continuously to a minimum value of 20%. In clutch test mode – not used.
The "Select" button @D_5_IMG_004_PHOTO_select-button-control_button – is intended for turning on/off the test mode of the electromagnetic valve and/or clutch.

The tester comes with a diagnostic cable, which has the following color coding:
Red – "B+" – battery positive;
Black – "B-" – battery negative;
Green – intended for connecting the electromagnetic clutch;
Yellow – intended for connecting the electromagnetic valve.

4.1. Tester menu
The tester is powered by the car battery through the B+ and B- clamps of the diagnostic cable. When power is supplied, the tester will turn on and the tester menu will be displayed on the screen, divided into two working zones (see Fig. 3 @D_5_IMG_006_DIAGRAM_tester-menu-clutch-valve-zones_fig3): 
"CLUTCH" – the zone for the results of the electromagnetic clutch test;
"VALVE" – the zone for the results of the electromagnetic valve test.

Figure 3. Tester menu @D_5_IMG_006_DIAGRAM_tester-menu-clutch-valve-zones_fig3

The "CLUTCH" zone contains the following test indicators:
"Current" – the current value of the current consumed by the electromagnetic clutch, in Amperes.
"Voltage" – the current value of the power source voltage (car battery), in Volts.
The "VALVE" zone contains the following test indicators:
"Current" – the current value of the current consumed by the electromagnetic valve, in Amperes. It can change when the valve opening degree changes.
"Duty, %" – the degree of opening of the electromagnetic valve, expressed as a percentage. Corresponds to the change in the duty cycle of the pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal. 
Each of the test zones contains "CB" (circuit broken) and "SC" (short circuit) indicators – their color indication corresponds to the open circuit or short circuit of the tested element.
Each test zone also contains "OFF/ON" indicators that inform about the active test mode. Some electromagnetic clutches may have a limit diode in their design for reverse current protection. If there is a diode in the tested clutch, a corresponding diode indicator will appear next to the "ON" indicator (see Fig. 4 @D_5_IMG_007_DIAGRAM_diode-symbol-display-screen_fig4). 

Figure 4. Display of the diode symbol on the tester screen @D_5_IMG_007_DIAGRAM_diode-symbol-display-screen_fig4

During the diagnosis of the electromagnetic valve, if the current consumption exceeds 6 A, a corresponding message will appear (see Fig. 5 @D_5_IMG_008_DIAGRAM_overcurrent-warning-message_fig5).

5. APPROPRIATE USE
1. Use the tester as intended only (see Section 1).
2. The tester is intended for indoor use. When using the tester, consider the following operating limitations:
2.1. The tester should be operated at temperatures from +10 to +40 °C and relative humidity from 10 to 75% without condensation.
2.2. Do not operate the tester at sub-zero temperatures or high humidity (over 75%). When moving the tester from a cold environment (outdoors) to a warm one, condensation may form on its elements, so do not turn on the tester immediately. Allow it to acclimate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
3. Ensure that the tester is not exposed to prolonged direct sunlight.
4. Do not store the tester near heaters, microwave ovens, or other equipment that generates high temperatures.
5. Avoid dropping the tester or getting technical fluids on it.
6. Do not connect the yellow and green diagnostic cable wires to any power source or battery.
7. Avoid shorting the crocodile clips of the diagnostic cable to any conductive parts of the car, including the body.
8. Do not place the tester on the car battery. Avoid shorting the tester case to any conductive parts of the car.
9. Do not make any changes to the tester's electrical circuit.
10. Turn off the tester when not in use.
5. In case of any malfunctions in the tester's operation, stop using it immediately and contact the manufacturer's technical support or sales representative.

5.1. Safety guidelines
1. Only specially trained personnel who are authorized to work with certain types of equipment and have received instruction on safe working practices and methods are allowed to operate the station. 

6. DIAGNOSIS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC CLUTCH SEPARATELY FROM THE AIR CONDITIONER COMPRESSOR 
Diagnosis is performed as follows:
1. Connect the tester to a 12V DC power source, and the tester's diagnostic menu will appear on the screen.
WARNING! Do not connect the yellow and green clamps to the battery, as this will damage the tester.
2. Connect the green wires to the electromagnetic clutch. The polarity of the connection does not matter.
3. Press the "Select" button on the tester – the measurement results will be displayed on the tester screen.
3.1. The electromagnetic clutch can be considered functional based on the following indicators:
•The "Current" value should be between 2 and 4A;
•The "Voltage" value should approximately match the power source voltage;
•The absence of "CB" or "SC" indicators on the display;
•The electromagnetic clutch can magnetize iron objects.
4. After the diagnostic process, disconnect the tester wires from the battery and the clutch.

7. DIAGNOSIS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC CLUTCH AND ELECTROMAGNETIC VALVE ON THE CAR
Diagnosis of the electromagnetic valve is performed as part of the air conditioner compressor without removing it from the car (see Fig. 6 @D_5_IMG_009_DIAGRAM_checking-electromagnetic-valve-clutch-on-car_fig6). The electromagnetic clutch can be checked in the same way. The diagnosis is performed as follows:
1. Connect the refrigerant pressure gauge set (manifold) to the service ports of the system.
2. Connect the yellow wires to the electromagnetic valve.
3. Connect the black and red wires to the car battery, and the tester's diagnostic menu will appear on the screen.
WARNING! If the valve or clutch connector has a single contact, use an external battery to power the tester. Connecting it to the car battery will result in an error.

Figure 6. Diagram of checking the electromagnetic valve and clutch on the car @D_5_IMG_009_DIAGRAM_checking-electromagnetic-valve-clutch-on-car_fig6:
1 – Compressor; 2 – Electromagnetic clutch connector; 3 – Electromagnetic valve connector; 4 – Service ports; 5 – Manifold gauge set.

4. Press the "Select" button on the tester – the measurement results will be displayed on the tester screen.
4.1. Check the "CB" or "SC" indicators to ensure there is no open circuit or short circuit in the valve. If one of them is on, the valve is faulty.
7. If there is no open or short circuit in the valve, start the car engine.
6. Use the "Up" and "Down" buttons to change the PWM signal duty cycle on the valve. With a functional valve, changing the degree of its opening (Duty, %) will change the pressure in the high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) lines. The absence of these changes indicates a faulty valve. 
7. After the diagnostic process, stop the car engine and disconnect the tester wires from the battery and the compressor.

8. TESTER MAINTENANCE
The tester is designed for a long period of operation and does not require preventive maintenance; however, during operation, the following points should be monitored:
• Ensure that the environment is suitable for the operation of the stand (temperature, humidity, etc.).
