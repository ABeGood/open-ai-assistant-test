Equipment for Diagnostics of Electric Vehicles and Hybrids
The growing popularity of electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles creates new challenges for auto services. Modern electric vehicles are technically complex systems requiring a professional approach to diagnostics and service. MSG Equipment develops and manufactures specialized equipment for testing and servicing electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles, allowing independent auto services to expand their range of provided services.

Types of Equipment for Electric Vehicle and Hybrid Diagnostics
For comprehensive work with electric vehicles, auto services need specialized equipment of various types:
• Testers for high-voltage battery diagnostics
• Equipment for balancing battery module elements
• Systems for checking capacity of nickel-metal hydride (Ni-Mh) batteries
• Diagnostic equipment for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries
• Testers for working with mild hybrid (MHEV) batteries
• Equipment for determining LFP (LiFePO4) element condition
• Control and analysis systems for high-voltage batteries

Functional Capabilities of Electric Vehicle Diagnostics and Service Equipment
High-voltage battery diagnostic testers provide determination of actual capacity of battery modules. This allows identification of modules with reduced characteristics requiring replacement. Multi-channel diagnostic systems provide simultaneous testing of multiple cells, significantly reducing high-voltage battery service time.
Cell balancing equipment equalizes voltage on series-connected battery elements. During electric vehicle operation, voltage differences may occur between battery elements, affecting overall battery capacity. Professional equipment allows restoration of balance between elements, extending the entire battery service life.
Modern diagnostic systems monitor battery charge and discharge processes, necessary for accurate parameter determination. Regenerative discharge technology is particularly valuable, where energy from tested batteries is returned to the electrical grid, improving energy efficiency and environmental friendliness of the diagnostic process. Test results are stored in device memory and can be analyzed using special software.

Technical Specifications of Electric Vehicle Testing Equipment
Modern diagnostic equipment for electric vehicles has the following technical capabilities:
• Multi-channel architecture with independent galvanically isolated testing channels
• Support for various battery types: NMC, NCA, LFP (LiFePO4)
• Voltage ranges: for Ni-Mh up to 20V, for Li-Ion up to 4.2V per channel or 62V per module
• Ability to set charge and discharge currents
• Use of regenerative discharge technology with energy return to grid
• Automatic operation mode according to specified testing scenarios
• Built-in resistive loads for internal resistance measurement
• Element temperature control during diagnostics
• RJ45 (Ethernet) network interface: providing online functions for launching service tasks
• Support for BMS (Battery Management System) operation via RS485 bus
• Interaction with 48-volt mild hybrid battery systems via CAN bus

Protection Systems in Electric Vehicle Diagnostic Equipment
Working with high-voltage batteries involves certain risks, so electric vehicle diagnostic equipment is equipped with comprehensive protection systems:
• Protection against overcharging and over-discharging of battery modules
• Prevention of element overheating during diagnostics
• Protection against incorrect connection (reverse polarity)
• Protection against short circuit of connected cables
• Equipment operating temperature control
• Automatic diagnostics termination when parameters exceed allowable limits

These safety systems guarantee preservation of expensive battery modules during diagnostics and service, and ensure auto service personnel safety when working with high-voltage electric vehicle components.

Diagnostic Equipment Capabilities for Various Electric Vehicle Types
Electric vehicle diagnostic equipment is adapted for work with various electric vehicle types:
• Full electric vehicles with high-voltage traction batteries
• Hybrid vehicles with nickel-metal hydride batteries
• Plug-in hybrids with high-capacity lithium-ion batteries
• Mild hybrids (MHEV) with 48-volt systems
• Electric vehicles with LFP (lithium iron phosphate) element batteries

Diagnostic equipment universality allows auto services to work with electric and hybrid vehicles from various manufacturers, ensuring high service levels for these vehicle owners.

Advantages of Using Professional Electric Vehicle Equipment
Implementation of specialized electric vehicle diagnostic equipment opens several significant advantages for auto services:
• Providing complete range of high-voltage system diagnostic services
• Ability to perform repair work previously available only at dealers
• Accurate battery condition diagnostics with detailed report generation
• Increased safety of high-voltage component work
• Increased auto service profitability through high-tech service provision

Recommendations for Electric Vehicle Diagnostic Equipment Selection
When selecting equipment for electric vehicle diagnostics and service, several key factors should be considered. First, it is necessary to focus on the range of serviced vehicles, determining predominant battery system types. For services specializing in hybrid vehicles, equipment supporting both nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries would be optimal.
It is also important to consider auto service scale and planned electric vehicle work volume. For large service centers, equipment with many diagnostic channels allowing simultaneous testing of multiple modules is recommended. Small auto services may find compact solutions with fewer channels sufficient.
Attention should be paid to software capabilities supplied with diagnostic equipment. Convenient interface, ability to create detailed PDF reports and regular software updates are important factors when selecting electric vehicle diagnostic equipment.
