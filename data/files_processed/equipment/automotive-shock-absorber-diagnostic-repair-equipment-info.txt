Title: Equipment for Diagnostics and Repair of Automotive Shock Absorbers | MSG Equipment
Description: Professional equipment for testing and gas filling of automotive shock absorbers. Diagnostic stands and service systems for accurate fault detection and quality repair of all types of shock absorbers.

EQUIPMENT FOR DIAGNOSTICS AND REPAIR OF AUTOMOTIVE SHOCK ABSORBERS
Shock absorbers are an important element of vehicle suspension, responsible for stability, safety and comfort during driving. Functional shock absorbers effectively dampen suspension oscillations, prevent vehicle swaying, improve wheel contact with the road surface and reduce load on other chassis components. Timely diagnostics and qualified repair of shock absorbers contribute to proper suspension functioning and comfortable driving. Professional equipment for shock absorber diagnostics allows precise identification of their malfunctions and quality repair work.

Professional Equipment for Diagnostics and Repair of Automotive Shock Absorbers
MSG Equipment offers specialized equipment for both testing and repair of shock absorbers. The diagnostic stand allows high-precision determination of shock absorber technical condition, while filling equipment provides their professional restoration. The equipment line includes:
• Stand for comprehensive shock absorber diagnostics - allows assessment of technical condition of shock absorbers for different vehicle types, determination of malfunction nature and necessity for their repair
• Equipment for gas filling of shock absorbers - provides gas filling of single-tube and twin-tube shock absorbers after repair work

Capabilities of Equipment for Diagnostics and Repair of Automotive Shock Absorbers
Equipment for shock absorber diagnostics provides testing of shock absorber characteristics at various oscillation frequencies from 10 to 180 oscillations per minute, testing of operating characteristics of shock absorbers with different mounting types and assessment of their compliance with technical requirements. The stand allows control testing after repair, measurement of shock absorber temperature during testing and adjustment of working stroke in the range from 50 to 150 mm. Diagnostics is performed in automatic or manual mode through a touch display with intuitive interface. Test results can be saved and printed, and the stand software is regularly updated.
Equipment for gas filling shock absorbers is designed to restore shock absorber functionality after repair. The system provides filling of both single-tube and twin-tube shock absorbers with working pressure up to 120 bar.
