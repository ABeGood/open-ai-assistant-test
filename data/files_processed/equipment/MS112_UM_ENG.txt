6.1. Possible issues during compressor diagnosis and their solutions
To obtain accurate results, it's important that the compressor has the correct amount of oil. Excess or insufficient oil can lead to erroneous test results. Before testing, it's recommended to pour 30 ml (cm3) of oil into the LP hose of the compressor. The oil type is indicated on the compressor's label.
Because nitrogen doesn't mix with the compressor oil, the oil tends to accumulate in the cavity of the front cover of the compressor, behind the valve plate (Figure 14 @D_33_IMG_020_DIAGRAM_compressor-oil-accumulation_fig14). This is especially relevant for Denso compressors.

Figure 14 @D_33_IMG_020_DIAGRAM_compressor-oil-accumulation_fig14

The test might fail, and the test bench will display one of the messages: "The compressor is not building pressure" or "Poor compressor performance." If this happens, try one of the two actions described below and repeat the test.

Option 1
Conduct the compressor test in a vertical position as shown in Figure 15 @D_33_IMG_021_PHOTO_vertical-test-position_fig15.
Figure 15 @D_33_IMG_021_PHOTO_vertical-test-position_fig15

Option 2
Dismount the compressor from the test bench.
Unscrew the safety valve on the compressor and drain the oil into a clean container (Figure 16 @D_33_IMG_022_PHOTO_oil-draining-procedure_fig16-1 @D_33_IMG_023_PHOTO_oil-draining-procedure_fig16-2). Then screw the safety valve back into place.

Figure 16 @D_33_IMG_022_PHOTO_oil-draining-procedure_fig16-1 @D_33_IMG_023_PHOTO_oil-draining-procedure_fig16-2

Next, unscrew the fitting from the LP line and pour approximately 30 ml (cm3) of oil into it. The oil type is indicated on the compressor's label.
Install and secure the fitting. Afterward, place the compressor back on the test bench and repeat the test.

7. TEST BENCH MAINTENANCE
