USER MANUAL
INTRODUCTION
Thank you for choosing TM "MSG Equipment" products.
This User Manual contains information about the purpose, equipment, technical specifications, and operating rules of the MS900 stand.
Before using the MS900 stand (hereinafter referred to as the "stand"), carefully study this User Manual and, if necessary, undergo special training at the stand manufacturer's facility.
Due to continuous improvements in the stand's design, equipment, and software (hereinafter referred to as "software"), changes may be made that are not reflected in this User Manual. The pre-installed software on the stand is subject to updates, and its support may be discontinued without prior notice.

1. APPLICATION
The stand is designed for cleaning particulate filters (hereinafter referred to as "filters") of passenger cars, trucks, and buses. Cleaning the particulate filters is done by flushing them with a stream of warm water. By periodically changing the direction of the flow and delivering compressed air pulses, high-quality cleaning of the particulate filter is achieved without the use of cleaning agents. For convenience in keeping track of serviced filters, the stand allows saving the results of the cleanings and printing them on an external Bluetooth printer.

The stand consists of three modules:
MS900A - diagnostic and drying module;
MS900B - flushing module;
MS900C - washing and drying chamber.
The MS900A and MS900B modules are self-sufficient and operate independently of each other.
