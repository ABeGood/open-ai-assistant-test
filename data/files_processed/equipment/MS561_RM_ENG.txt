3. Carefully disconnect the back wall where the power connector is located.

4. Remove the case cover by pulling it to the side of the disassembled back wall. 
Attention! Remove very carefully so as not to damage the wires on the board connectors, which should be bent as close to the board as possible. @D_12_IMG_004_PHOTO_case-cover-removal-procedure_fig3

9. Unscrew 2 screws on the disassembled board, which hold the inter-board racks, see Fig. 8. @D_12_IMG_009_PHOTO_inter-board-racks-removal_fig8
Figure 8 @D_12_IMG_009_PHOTO_inter-board-racks-removal_fig8

10. Install the just removed 2 inter-board racks on the new board in the places indicated in Fig. 9. @D_12_IMG_010_PHOTO_new-board-rack-installation_fig9
Figure 9 @D_12_IMG_010_PHOTO_new-board-rack-installation_fig9
Attention! When installing inter-board racks, install a dielectric gasket, see Fig. 10. @D_12_IMG_011_PHOTO_dielectric-gasket-installation_fig10
Figure 10 @D_12_IMG_011_PHOTO_dielectric-gasket-installation_fig10

11. Unscrew 3 screws at the bottom of the tester, see Fig. 11. @D_12_IMG_012_PHOTO_bottom-tester-screws-power-supply_fig11
Figure 11 @D_12_IMG_012_PHOTO_bottom-tester-screws-power-supply_fig11

12. Move the power supply block from the OBD connector. Unscrew 2 screws on the OBD connector and remove it. @D_12_IMG_013_PHOTO_OBD-connector-screw-removal_fig12

13. Remove the lock from the OBD connector, for this it is necessary to press the lock tabs with a screwdriver and pull it in the direction indicated in Fig. 13. @D_12_IMG_014_PHOTO_OBD-connector-lock-removal_fig13
Figure 13 @D_12_IMG_014_PHOTO_OBD-connector-lock-removal_fig13

14. Connect the additional OBD cable (Fig. 14 @D_12_IMG_016_PHOTO_Connect-additional-OBD-cable_fig14) to the free 11 and 13 pins in the OBD connector, see Fig. 15 @D_12_IMG_017_PHOTO_OBD-connector-pin-connection_fig15.

15. Install the lock on the OBD connector and screw the connector into place.

16. On the cut 7 wires (6 red and 1 black), it is necessary to put heat shrink tubing and crimp the M4 ring terminals. Then shrink the heat shrink tubing on the terminal. @D_12_IMG_018_PHOTO_wire-terminal-preparation_fig16
