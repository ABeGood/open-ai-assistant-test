5. APPROPRIATE USE
1. Use the test bench as intended only (see Section 1).
2. The bench is intended for indoor use at temperatures ranging from +10 to +40 °C and with relative humidity not exceeding 75% without condensation.
3. Do not turn on the bench if there are any hydraulic system leaks or if the fluid reservoir does not contain the required amount of operating fluid.
4. Operate the bench in a way that protects the environment and the natural resources of our planet. Do not allow operating fluid to leak into the ground or sewage system.

5. Use the "EMERGENCY STOP" button only when it is necessary to urgently shut off the bench.
6. Turn off the bench when it is not in use.
7. When working with the bench, it is prohibited to:
— Diagnose units with obvious mechanical faults.;
— Interfere with the operation of the bench in any way.
8. To prevent the damage and the failure of the bench, do not make any modifications in the bench in your discretion. Any modifications can be effected by the official manufacturer only. Should the bench have defects contact the manufacturer or a dealer.
9. In case of failures in the operation of the bench, stop further operation and contact the manufacturer or sales representative.
WARNING! The manufacturer is not responsible for any damage or injury to human health resulting from non-compliance with the requirements of this user manual.

5.1. Safety guidelines
1. The test bench shall be operated by the workers qualified to work with certain types of equipment and received appropriate training in the safe operation. 
2. The workplace must be kept clean and well lit. Clutter and unlit areas of the workplace can lead to accidents.
3. When working with the bench, personal protective equipment for eyes and hands must be used – technical rubber gloves (nitrile gloves) and closed protective goggles. Avoid contact of the operating fluid with exposed skin (in case of contact, wash with warm water and soap).
4. To ensure electrical and fire safety, it is FORBIDDEN to:
— Connect the bench to an electrical network with a faulty overload protection or one that lacks such protection.
— Operate the bench in a faulty condition.
— Perform repairs or modifications to the bench independently.
5. It is forbidden to disconnect high-pressure hoses or remove quick-release couplings while the bench is operating.
6. The use of damaged high-pressure hoses is prohibited.

5.2. Preparing the bench for operation
The bench is delivered packaged. Unpack the bench. After unpacking, ensure that the bench is intact and free of any damage. If damage is found, contact the manufacturer or sales representative before turning on the bench.
The bench should be placed on a solid, level horizontal surface. If necessary, level the bench using the adjustable feet. When installing and moving the bench, hold it exclusively by the base (frame). Ensure a minimum clearance of 0.6 meters from the rear of the bench for servicing.
Before operating the bench, it is necessary to:
1) Fill with new ATF oil (see section 7.1).
WARNING! To avoid malfunctions of the bench and the units being diagnosed, use only new ATF oil.
2) Connect to a 400V electrical network using the socket provided with the bench, following the L1 L2 L3 N PE markings inside the socket when connecting to the power supply.
3) Turn on the automatic switch – voltage relay (see position 7 in Fig. 1).
WARNING! The bench has a phase relay located next to the automatic switch. If the red indicator on the phase relay lights up after connecting the bench to the 400V network, the bench will not turn on. In this case, swap any two adjacent phases in the socket, e.g., L1 and L2.
4) Connect the compressed air source to the MS522 vise.

6. STEERING RACK DIAGNOSTICS
The sequence of diagnostic operations on the bench is as follows:
1. Turn on the bench.
2. Secure the rack in the vise.
WARNING! Be careful to avoid injuring your fingers.
3. Install limit tips or tie rods on the ends of the steering rack shaft.
4. Mount a suitable fitting on the rack.
5. Connect the high-pressure hoses to the rack as shown in Figure 2. @D_8_IMG_002_DIAGRAM_steering-rack-connection-to-bench_fig2
WARNING! Strictly observe the connection of high and low pressure. Incorrect connection can lead to sudden spontaneous rotation of the steering wheel shaft, causing injury.
6. Secure a tool for rotating the spool valve shaft (it is recommended to use universal locking pliers).
7. Turn on the bench pump by pressing the START button.

Figure 2. Connecting the steering rack to the bench @D_8_IMG_002_DIAGRAM_steering-rack-connection-to-bench_fig2:
1 - Low-pressure fitting; 2 - High-pressure fitting;
3 - High-pressure line; 4 - Low-pressure line.

8. Measure the pressure and fluid flow readings at different positions of the spool valve.
8.1. Move the rack shaft right/left by smoothly rotating the spool valve shaft to the stop.
8.2. Based on the readings of pressure gauge 4 and flowmeter 1 (see Fig. 1) and the criteria outlined in Table 1, determine the condition of the steering rack.
9. Turn off the bench pump with the STOP button and switch off the bench.
10. Disconnect the bench from the rack.

* standard for particular power steering racks. For example, Alfa Romeo 145, Audi 80

7. TEST BENCH MAINTENANCE
The bench is designed for long-term operation and does not have special maintenance requirements. However, for maximum trouble-free operation, it is necessary to regularly monitor its technical condition, namely:
• Is the engine operating normally (any unusual sounds, vibrations, etc.)?
• Hydraulic system tightness (visual inspection);
• Check the condition of the filter (filter element CR091C10R) every 6 months. Replace if necessary.
• Level and condition of the operating fluid. After diagnostics, a small amount of operating fluid remains in the pump, so monitor the level of the operating fluid in the tank using level gauge 8 (Fig. 1). The level should not drop below 50% of the tank volume.

7.1. Replacement of the operating fluid
The condition of the operating fluid and the need for its replacement are assessed visually - by its appearance. It should be clear, homogeneous, and free of sediment. In this case, the replacement of the operating fluid and the hydraulic system filtering element (CR091C10R) of the bench should be performed no less than once a year of operation.
A valve installed under the collecting tray is provided for draining the operating fluid. Refilling the hydraulic system is done through the filling neck of the operating fluid tank (see Fig. 5 @D_8_IMG_003_PHOTO_filter-and-filler-neck_fig3). 
Figure 3. Filter and filler neck (left to right) @D_8_IMG_003_PHOTO_filter-and-filler-neck_fig3

7.2. Cleaning and care
Soft cloths or rags should be used to clean the surface of the bench using neutral cleaning agents. Do not use abrasives and solvents to avoid corrosion, malfunction or damage to the bench.

8. DISPOSAL
Equipment deemed unfit for use must be disposed of.
The equipment does not contain any chemical, biological, or radioactive elements that could harm human health or the environment when proper storage and usage rules are followed.
Disposal of the equipment must comply with local, regional, and national laws and regulations. Do not dispose of non-biodegradable materials (PVC, rubber, synthetic resins, petroleum products, synthetic oils, etc.) in the environment. For the disposal of such materials, contact companies specializing in the collection and disposal of industrial waste.
Copper and aluminum parts, considered non-ferrous metal waste, should be collected and sold.
