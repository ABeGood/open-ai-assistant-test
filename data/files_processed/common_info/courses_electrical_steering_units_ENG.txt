1. Course Title
Diagnostics and Repair of Electric Power Steering (EPS)

2. Brief Description (Subtitle)
Practical course that will provide understanding of electric power steering operation, teach fault identification, use of measuring instruments and conducting EPS diagnostics and repair.

3. Full Course Description
The "Diagnostics and Repair of Electric Power Steering" course is developed for specialists who want to obtain comprehensive knowledge and practical skills in EPS diagnostics and repair.
This course is designed for 4 days. The training covers theoretical aspects of steering system operation, types of power steering systems (Hydraulic, Electro-hydraulic, Electro-mechanical), as well as their operating principles. Special attention is paid to electronic components, their testing and interaction with diagnostic equipment.
The practical part of the course is conducted using real unit diagnostics examples: EPS pumps and racks, control units and sensors using modern diagnostic equipment - the MS561 PRO tester. Participants will learn to identify and eliminate both mechanical and electronic faults.
The course also covers working with software for coding, adaptation and calibration of control units, which is an important part of modern EPS repair.
